Dataset: `b424ac8455d9622452adb6e005a06cc61ef7c716270ddbfdfdbf6d4133d3ca2d`

Split: `development`; evaluation set: `33652665b3231e705348100ca5c1e727886a9d3c97daff7204c8cb560561e14a`

| Mode | Questions | Errors | Mean latency (s) | Retrieval recall | Correctness | Groundedness | Relevance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| agentic | 1 | 0 | 141.193 | 0.500 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 1.000 |

## Mean stage timings (seconds)

The total includes judging and local evaluation work. Retrieval includes reranking;
rerank and judge sub-stages overlap their parent timings and must not be added again.
A dash means the stage was not run or was not measured.

| Mode | RAG pipeline | Retrieval | Rerank | Generation | Reference judge | Grounding judge | Total |

### Agentic synthesis breakdown (seconds)

These sub-stages are already included in Generation above. Review combines
both attempts. Means cover measured runs only; repair means exclude runs
without repair (see sample_counts in summary.json).

| Mode | Draft | Review(s) | Repair (when run) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| agentic | 31.235 | 42.809 | 8.173 |
