Dataset: `b424ac8455d9622452adb6e005a06cc61ef7c716270ddbfdfdbf6d4133d3ca2d`

Split: `development`; evaluation set: `d86b803930f2bf7e8cee8918efd477ecbea204c81f34f0198f434831fbbf7b0e`

| Mode | Questions | RAG errors | Judge errors | Mean latency (s) | Retrieval recall | Correctness | Correctness scored / unscored | Groundedness | Groundedness scored / unscored | Relevance |

## Judge failures and grounding annotations

Judge errors do not discard completed RAG answers, evidence or retrieval metrics.
Invalid grounding annotations share the existing single retry; unresolved annotations
leave groundedness null/unscored, not a fabricated answer penalty.

- agentic: 0 judge error(s); grounding question IDs needing review: none.

## Judge consistency

Unresolved reference correctness is null/unscored, not zero or a promoted score.
Means use scored samples only; compare scored/unscored counts before comparing modes.
Unresolved contradictions/source ambiguities need manual review, not a conclusion of poor RAG quality.
A clean check means no detected conflict, not proof of semantic correctness.

- agentic: 0 run(s) flagged during judging; question IDs still needing review: none.

## Mean stage timings (seconds)

The total includes judging and local evaluation work. Retrieval includes reranking;
rerank and judge sub-stages overlap their parent timings and must not be added again.
A dash means the stage was not run or was not measured.

| Mode | RAG pipeline | Retrieval | Rerank | Generation | Reference judge | Grounding judge | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| agentic | 32.644 | 10.780 | — | 21.855 | 4.217 | 1.848 | 38.71 |

### Agentic synthesis breakdown (seconds)

These sub-stages are already included in Generation above. Review combines
both attempts. Means cover measured runs only; repair means exclude runs
without repair (see sample_counts in summary.json).

| Mode | Draft | Review(s) | Repair (when run) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| agentic | 4.121 | 11.671 | 5.723 |

## Agentic execution

Mean rounds: `1.0`; mean tool calls: `2.0`; mean evidence chunks: `16.0`; mean planner tokens: `13105.0`. Named-paper full coverage: `1.0` across `1` detected runs.
