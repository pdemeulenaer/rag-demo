A large collection of artificial clusters was studied to model the different degeneracies in the age, mass, extinction, and metallicity parameter space when stochasticity is taken into account in the cluster models. We show that, without prior knowledge on the metallicity, the optical bands (UBVRI) fail to allow a correct derivation of the age, mass, and extinction because of the strong degeneracies between models of different metallicities. Adding near-infrared information $\\scriptstyle ( U B V R I + J H K )$ slightly helps in improving the parameter derivation, except for the metallicity. Adding ultraviolet data (GALEX $+ U B V R I )$ helps significantly in deriving these parameters and allows constraining the metallicity when the photometric errors have a Gaussian distribution with standard deviations 0.05 mag for UBVRI and $0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { { m a g } }$ for the GALEX bands.

(2004) and Bridžius et al. (2008). However, this method is strongly biased by degeneracies between parameters and by the stochastic presence of bright stars that dominate the integrated photometry. The problem of deriving of the age and mass of clusters taking stochasticity into account has been studied in, for instance, by Popescu & Hanson (2009, 2010), when the photometric data were corrected for extinction before the analysis. Simultaneous derivation of age, mass, and extinction has been studied in Fouesneau & Lançon (2010), Fouesneau et al. (2012), de Meulenaer et al. (2013; hereafter Paper I), and in Anders et al. (2013). A recent review of the progress in the field has been compiled by Cerviño (2013). Anders et al. (2013) also studied the derivation of metallicity for narrow ranges of extinction and metallicity search, centered on the input values. The aim of this paper is to extend the study of de Meulenaer et al. (2013) to a wide range of metallicities, from $Z = 0 . 0 3$ to $Z = 0 . 0 0 0 1 3$ .

Section 3 presents the method of deriving the cluster physical parameters developed in Paper I, but here with the addition of the metallicity dimension. Section 4 discusses the ability of the method to derive the age, mass, and extinction, using different photometric systems. The input metallicity of the artificial cluster sample is fixed to one value and the parameters are derived using a model grid of one fixed metallicity, which can be different from the input metallicity. This allows inspecting the metallicity effect on the derivation of the age, mass, and extinction. Section 5 explores the derivation of cluster parameters when the model grid contains models of different metallicities, so that we evaluate how accurately we can constrain the metallicity in addition to the age, mass, and extinction for various photometric systems.

The scatter around the true mass is also more strongly reduced than for UBVRI and UBVRIJHK. The metallicities are now better derived as well, even when the true metallicity is $Z =$ 0 005, the boundary effects are significantly reduced. Moreover, .at least half of the clusters are classified with the correct metallicity when ultraviolet data are added to the optical. In Figs. 5b and c, the SSPs (and also the discrete model distributions) overlap much less than in optical passbands. In Fig. 5c, the combination of far-ultraviolet with optical $U$ passband allows us to distinguish between the different metallicities, as the reddening vector is now nearly parallel to the SSPs (especially at young ages) and that the SSPs are more spaced, compared with the error bars (see the zoom plot).

Now, without degeneracies introduced by extinction, the derivation of the other parameters is much more accurate. For all photometric systems, the effect of the metallicity on the age derivation manifests itself through a slight shift of the ages above or below the one-to-one black dashed line. Concerning the metallicity derivation, one can see that even in this case when there is no extinction, a consistent derivation of the metallicity with only UBVRI filters is not possible, despite a strong decrease of boundary effects on the metallicity, compared with the case where extinction was included (compare Figs. 6 and 7). For example, only ${ \\sim } 3 5 \\%$ of clusters are classified in the region of the correct metallicity when the true metallicity is $Z = 0 . 0 0 5$ . Using .UBVRIJHK, the metallicity of clusters is better derived than in the case with unknown extinction, and the metallicity boundary effects are decreased. In the worst case, at least ${ \\sim } 5 5 \\%$ of clusters are classified with a correct metallicity. Hence, the break of degeneracies with metallicity can be efficiently achieved with UBVRIJHK photometric system only when the extinction is well constrained beforehand.
