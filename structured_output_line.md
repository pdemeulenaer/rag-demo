INTRODUCTION  Electrochemical sensor technologies have evolved in recent decades,  revolutionising various fields such as food safety and healthcare. As the  complexity and scale of these applications increase, so does the demand for  analytical systems that are precise, dependable, cost-effective, and capable of  providing real-time data. This growing need for better sensors requires the  development of new materials and innovative techniques that can enhance the  sensitivity, stability, and selectivity of the analysis. Among the materials  explored, conductive polymers and their composites have emerged as critical  components in next-generation sensor design, offering unique electrochemical  properties that are well-suited to address these challenges.  The development of sensors, which meet the increasingly strict  requirements of modern applications, is a complex task beyond simply  selecting the suitable materials. It also involves integrating these materials into  composite systems that deliver enhanced performance. For example, it is  possible to create composite structures with superior characteristics by  combining conductive polymers with other functional materials, such as  underlayers, self-assembled monolayers (SAM) or aptamers.   Electrochemical  methods  such  as  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy (EIS), square wave voltammetry (SWV), and pulsed  amperometric detection (PAD) have become indispensable tools in the  advancement of sensor technologies. EIS is a versatile technique used to  analyse the electrical properties of sensor surfaces. By measuring the  electrochemical impedance of a system over a range of frequencies, EIS  provides detailed information about the changes on the electrode surface,  allowing the analysis of the formation of SAM or molecularly imprinted  polymer (MIP). This technique is particularly valuable for assessing the  stability of these modifications, as well as for detecting changes at the sensor  interface when an analyte is present. SWV is another advanced technique used  in sensor development and is known for its high sensitivity and resolution,  making it ideal for detecting low concentrations of analytes. PAD plays a  crucial role in the electropolymerisation of polymers on the sensor surface by  using controlled pulses to form the conductive polymer layer. Additionally,  PAD is used for the detailed characterisation of the electrode, assessing its  response to analytes and optimising sensor functionality.   These electrochemical techniques – EIS, SWV, and PAD – are robust and  reliable methods for analysing and quantifying surface modifications and  target analytes. Integrating these methods enables the development of highly  sensitive and selective diagnostic tools. The aim of the study is to apply advanced conducting polymer composite  production techniques for the development of molecularly imprinted polymer- based sensors and immunosensors.  The objectives of the study:  1.  To design a sensor based on screen-printed carbon electrode modified by  molecularly imprinted polypyrrole for the detection of Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria.  2.  To apply gold electrodes modified with different self-assembled  monolayers for the development of an immunosensor for the detection of  antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  3.  To develop a sensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid  protein using a composite made from a self-assembled monolayer-based  underlayer and a molecularly imprinted polypyrrole-based upper-layer.  4.  To develop a sensor designed to detect vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) using aptamers embedded in a conductive polypyrrole matrix.   Scientific novelty  The research presented in the dissertation is based on the application of  polypyrrole, a conducting polymer known for its high conductivity,  electrocatalytic activity, and biocompatibility. The study advances the field by  incorporating three distinct materials to enhance sensor performance:  underlayers, SAMs, and embedded aptamers.  The research presented in the dissertation employs MIPs, which are  synthesised by polymerising monomers around a target molecule. This creates  specific binding sites within the polymer matrix, enabling highly selective and  sensitive detection of analytes. Firstly, the dissertation explores creating an  underlayer beneath the MIP layer during sensor formation in order to address  challenges related to analyte diffusion and adsorption to the electrode surface.  Secondly, SAMs were used to reduce non-specific interactions and improve  biomolecule immobilisation efficiency. Specifically, combining SAM and  polypyrrole MIP composites could achieve improvements in the sensitivity  and selectivity of the sensor. This layer formation-based methodology ensures  the design of a more sensitive structure, while the MIP provides specific  binding sites for the target analytes. Lastly, the incorporation of aptamers into  the polymer matrix was explored. This allowed the creation of a polymer- stabilised sensing surface.  In this dissertation, the presented techniques were successfully employed  for the development of MIP-based sensors to detect Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, a leading cause of foodborne illness-related deaths. These sensors  were designed by using the molecular imprinting technique to create specific  binding sites for the target bacteria, enabling rapid and precise detection.  Similarly, for infectious disease diagnostics, conductive polymer composites  have been employed to create electrochemical immunosensors for detecting  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).   Overall, this research contributes to advancing sensor technologies by  demonstrating how developed conductive polymer composites can perform in  the design of selective and sensitive sensors. The continued innovation in this  area is expected to drive further progress in sensor technologies, addressing  the growing demand for efficient and reliable analytical devices across various  fields.  Statements for defence:  1.  A polypyrrole-based  underlayer  formed  by  using  the  pulsed  amperometric technique can be incorporated in the design of a  molecularly imprinted sensor employed for the detection of Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria.  2.  A gold electrode modified with a mixed self-assembled monolayer can  be applied for the development of a label-free immunosensor used to  detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  3.  A composite made of a self-assembled monolayer underlayer and  molecularly imprinted polypyrrole upper-layer can be used for the  development of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein sensor.  4.  Conductive polypyrrole matrix with embedded DNA aptamers can be  employed for the development of a sensor used to detect VEGF.

1. LITERATURE REVIEW  1.1. Conducting polymers   Conducting polymers have received a lot of attention due to their unique  combination of organic polymer properties and semiconductor-like electronic  characteristics. The synthesis of these polymers dates back to 1862 when the  English chemist H. Letheby performed the first known anodic oxidation of  aniline in a dilute sulphuric acid solution and obtained dark blue/black colour,  water-insoluble particles [1]. The modern development of conducting polymer  research began with the discovery of electrical conductivity by Shirakawa et  al. in 1977 [2]. Since then, these materials have been extensively studied for  their unique electrical properties.  Conducting polymers are π-π conjugated polymers that can conduct  electricity by means of doping [3]. π-π conjugated polymers are organic  macromolecules with a backbone chain composed of alternating double and  single bonds. Spatial π-π conjugation in their chains allows electrons to  delocalise throughout the molecule, allowing multiple atoms to share them.  Delocalised electrons can move throughout the molecule and become charge  carriers, making it conductive. However, because the polymers are covalently  bonded, the material must be doped for the continuous electron flow to occur.  Doping involves the addition or removal of electrons from a polymer structure  [4]. After the doping, π-orbital electrons can freely move through the polymer  chain, creating an electrical current. Furthermore, the chemical and physical  properties of polymers can be tailored by combining different monomers,  changing polymerisation conditions, and creating polymeric composites.  Polymers and their composites are increasingly being used in the development  of sensing devices.  Because of their distinct electronic, magnetic, and optical  properties, conducting polymers are extremely important in scientific and  technological applications [5–7]. The most frequently used conducting  polymers  are  polyaniline,  polypyrrole,  polyacetylene,  poly(3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene), and polythiophene.  1.1.1. The mechanism of polypyrrole synthesis  Among the various conducting polymers, polypyrrole (Ppy) is notable  for its ease of synthesis, environmental stability, and promising electrical  properties. Polypyrrole, derived from the pyrrole monomer, a five-membered  heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom, was discovered to be a  conducting polymer in 1968.

The mechanism of polypyrrole synthesis  Among the various conducting polymers, polypyrrole (Ppy) is notable  for its ease of synthesis, environmental stability, and promising electrical  properties. Polypyrrole, derived from the pyrrole monomer, a five-membered  heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom, was discovered to be a  conducting polymer in 1968. Ppy was initially synthesised chemically [8], but later research demonstrated that it can also be developed electrochemically.  While both chemical and electrochemical synthesis methods rely on oxidative  polymerisation, alternative techniques such as photochemically initiated [9]  and enzyme-catalysed polymerisation [10] exist but will not be discussed  further.   Electrochemical synthesis of conducting polymers has advantages, such  as the targeted formation of a polymer layer at the anode and the elimination  of oxidising agents. This direct electrochemical oxidation process simplifies  the synthesis pathway, enhances the purity of the resulting polymer, and  allows more precise control over the polymerisation conditions. Furthermore,  the polypyrrole is deposited on the electrode, allowing for additional  electrochemical analysis to be performed. Given its widespread use in  theoretical and practical contexts, the following discussion will concentrate  on the principles of electrochemical synthesis. Some properties of  electrochemically obtained conducting polymers are determined by the  employed electrochemical polymerisation technique. These techniques are  generally divided into two categories: galvanostatic and potentiostatic.  The galvanostatic technique creates a conducting polymer by  maintaining a constant current density during polymerisation. The resulting  polymer film is doped and conductive because dopant ions from the  electrolyte are incorporated into the polymer matrix as it forms [11]. This  technique allows to control the thickness of the polymer film by adjusting the  duration of the polymerisation process [12]. Because of its simplicity, the  galvanostatic technique is common for practical applications [13]. However,  choosing the appropriate polymerisation current density is critical because the  potential of the electrode increases during polymerisation as the polymer film  grows due to an increase in resistance. This rise in potential can promote side  reactions, lowering polymerisation efficiency [14]. Thus, this method is not  chosen in certain applications because managing the increasing resistance and  the potential side reactions is difficult, which can compromise the overall  efficiency of the polymerisation process.  The potentiostatic polymerisation technique, which applies a constant  positive potential for oxidative polymerisation, ensures the production of a  high-quality polymer film. Maintaining a potential that is sufficiently high for  effective polymerisation yet low enough to prevent undesirable secondary  reactions and polymer over-oxidation is crucial for achieving this quality  [15,16]. The modified pulse potentiostatic technique further improves the  film's properties by alternating between anodic pulses (+950 mV vs. Ag/AgCl  for 1 s) and cathodic pulses (0 mV for 30 s). This method initiates the reaction  and then allows time for the pyrrole concentration near the electrode to replenish, reducing the likelihood of side reactions. By applying at least 10  potential pulses with a rectangular profile, this approach minimises side  reactions and significantly enhances the uniformity, stability, and overall  quality of the polymer film [15] making it a promising method for further  study in this dissertation.   Understanding how the synthesis techniques lead to polypyrrole  formation is a complex but essential aspect. To delve into this, it is crucial to  first examine the underlying electrochemical polymerisation mechanism. This  process, which begins with the formation of the primary radical cation, is  illustrated in Figure 1.     Figure 1. Mechanism of polypyrrole electrochemical synthesis. Reprinted  with permission from [16].  The unpaired electron and positive charge are delocalized, and quantum  mechanical calculations indicate that the electron spin density is highest at the  ortho positions. As a result, radical coupling occurs primarily at these

positions [16–18]. When two primary radical cations combine, a positively  charged dimer is produced. The presence of two protons in this dimer distorts  the conjugation, causing rearomatisation via deprotonation and the formation  of a more energetically favourable neutral dimer. In the following steps, the  neutral dimer is oxidised at the anode, producing a new radical cation. This  oxidation process occurs at a lower potential than for the neutral pyrrole. The  next steps involve the coupling of dimer radical cations (and later oligomer  radical cations) with primary radical cations, followed by proton release and  rearomatisation. This cycle of oxidation, coupling, and rearomatisation  continues, resulting in the formation of polypyrrole. Although electron spin  density is highest at the ortho-position, as conjugation length increases, the  spin density spreads throughout the conjugated system. This can lead to  radicals coupling at different positions, disrupting linearity and causing  branching [19].   1.2. The formation and application of molecularly imprinted polymers   Having discussed the fundamentals of polypyrrole synthesis, the focus  will shift to molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP). This next chapter will  examine how molecular imprinting techniques are applied using polypyrrole  to create polymers with specific molecular recognition properties, enhancing  their functionality and application.  MIPs are formed through molecular imprinting, where molecular  recognition sites are formed within a polymer matrix by synthesising the  polymer in the presence of a target template. During polymerisation, the  complementary interactions between the functional monomers and the  template molecule are maintained in their spatial arrangement [20]. Molecular  imprinting involves several key steps, illustrated in Figure 2. First, a target  molecule, known as the template, is selected. This template is the specific  molecule or analyte that the polymer will be designed to recognise. Second,  the functional monomers, which have a chemical affinity for the template are  mixed with the template molecules, allowing them to interact through various  forces such as hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions. Third, the  polymerisation process is initiated, linking the functional monomers and  forming a polymer network around the template. Finally, after polymerisation,  the template molecule is removed, typically by washing with a solvent,  leaving behind specific cavities or imprints in the polymer that are  complementary in shape and chemical functionality to the original  template [21]. Figure 2. Molecular imprinting process for MIP formation: template  selection, polymerisation and template removal.  The resulting MIP has these imprinted sites that allow it to selectively  recognise and bind the target molecule. Thus, MIPs offer significant potential  in various fields, including biotechnology and environmental monitoring. A  notable application of MIPs is in protein-based affinity sensors, where they  are used to imprint target proteins within polymer matrices. These sensors  selectively recognise target analytes, such as specific proteins or polypeptides,  and generate measurable signals through integrated transducers [22].  Molecular imprinting enhances selectivity by creating binding sites that are  complementary to the imprinted analytes [23,24]. Protein-imprinted MIPs  offer a promising alternative to traditional sensors, which employ antibodies  and receptors and often face long-term stability challenges [25,26]. Although  achieving proper protein orientation within the polymer matrix and  maintaining correct protein conformation is challenging [27,28], the  development of protein-imprinted MIPs represents a significant advancement  in bioanalytical chemistry [29–31]. Additionally, MIP technology can be  extended to imprint larger entities, such as bacteria and viruses, for diagnostic  applications [32,33].   Understanding the interaction of analytes with electrochemical sensor  surfaces is crucial in the development of MIP-based sensors. Accurate control  over these interactions is key to enhancing the sensitivity, selectivity, and  overall analytical performance of the sensor. If not properly managed, analytes  may adsorb non-specifically on the surface rather than binding to the intended  imprints, leading to compromised results. Several strategies have been  systematically investigated to address the challenges posed by unwanted  analyte-surface interactions. One prominent approach involves the sequential  deposition of a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) underlayer, effectively  insulating the electrode surface from the effects of analyte adsorption. Another  approach of considerable interest is the integration of a self-assembled  monolayer (SAM) as an interfacial layer between the gold substrate and the  electrochemically deposited MIP. This SAM underlayer mitigates non- specific interactions, thereby enhancing the specificity of the sensor.

Additionally, an alternative strategy employs aptamers embedded within the  polymer matrix to function as selective recognition elements instead of the  MIP itself. These polymers with integrated aptamers are engineered to  selectively bind target proteins, thereby illustrating the adaptability and  potential of this approach in a wide array of biosensing applications. Further  details on these methodologies will be discussed in the following sections.  1.2.1. The formation of polymer underlayer   This approach involves the formation of a thin NIP underlayer, which  serves as a foundational layer before the synthesis of the MIP layer is  performed. This methodology has been effectively demonstrated for the  detection of flumequine using a surface acoustic wave (SAW) signal  transduction system [34]. According to experimental data and density  functional theory (DFT) calculations, flumequine molecules tend to interact  with the gold surface, thereby obstructing its electrochemical activity. A thin  NIP underlayer is deposited to mitigate this interference and improve the  adhesion of the MIP layer. This approach not only alleviates potential  interference but also enhances the overall efficacy of the MIP layer formation.  In this dissertation, a similar technique was employed, where incorporating an  NIP underlayer was crucial in improving the performance and reliability of  the MIP layer.  1.2.2.

Additionally, an alternative strategy employs aptamers embedded within the  polymer matrix to function as selective recognition elements instead of the  MIP itself. These polymers with integrated aptamers are engineered to  selectively bind target proteins, thereby illustrating the adaptability and  potential of this approach in a wide array of biosensing applications. Further  details on these methodologies will be discussed in the following sections.  1.2.1. The formation of polymer underlayer   This approach involves the formation of a thin NIP underlayer, which  serves as a foundational layer before the synthesis of the MIP layer is  performed. This methodology has been effectively demonstrated for the  detection of flumequine using a surface acoustic wave (SAW) signal  transduction system [34]. According to experimental data and density  functional theory (DFT) calculations, flumequine molecules tend to interact  with the gold surface, thereby obstructing its electrochemical activity. A thin  NIP underlayer is deposited to mitigate this interference and improve the  adhesion of the MIP layer. This approach not only alleviates potential  interference but also enhances the overall efficacy of the MIP layer formation.  In this dissertation, a similar technique was employed, where incorporating an  NIP underlayer was crucial in improving the performance and reliability of  the MIP layer.  1.2.2. The formation of a self-assembled monolayer on the gold surface  Another strategy involves using SAM as an interfacial layer in sensor  development. It offers a convenient, adaptable, and straightforward method to  customise the surface properties of metals, metal oxides, and semiconductors.  SAMs are organic layers formed by the absorption of molecular components  from either solution or the gas phase onto solid surfaces or in organised arrays  on the surface of liquids. These adsorbed molecules spontaneously arrange,  sometimes epitaxially, into crystalline or semicrystalline structures [35].  The molecules or ligands constituting SAMs possess a chemical  functional group, often called the "headgroup," which exhibits a specific  affinity for the substrate. The headgroup usually demonstrates a strong affinity  for the surface, displacing previously adsorbed organic materials. Various  headgroups selectively bind to metals, metal oxides, and semiconductors.  SAM is typically formed on a metal surface, where they establish chemical  bonds [36]. The process by which n-alkanethiols form SAMs on gold has been  extensively studied, particularly on single crystals of Au(111) in ultra-high  vacuum (UHV) [37,38]. However, the most accessible and common method  involves the adsorption of alkanethiols from an ethanolic solution onto  polycrystalline gold surfaces prepared by vapour phase deposition (Figure 3).  When gold films are transferred from an evaporator to a solution without  maintaining a vacuum, atmospheric contaminants quickly adsorb onto the  gold surface. The thiols must then displace these adsorbed materials and any  solvent from the surface.      Figure 3. Sequential stages of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formation on  gold substrate.  Initially, most of the thiols that form the SAM adsorb quickly, creating a  low mass coverage striped layer followed by a denser, upright layer within 5- 6 minutes, covering approximately 90% of the surface (Figure 3, Step 1) [39].  The chemisorption of the thiol onto the gold substrate causes two main effects:  (a) it induces local strain on the gold surface, which is relieved by releasing  gold atoms to form pits or "vacancy islands," and (b) it increases the mobility  of the gold-thiolate complex on the surface. During SAM formation, vacancy  islands coalesce, and gold adatoms move to the step edges, resulting in a  surface rougher than the original gold surface [37,38].  The alkanethiolate-gold complexes nucleate small crystalline regions of  the monolayer, which grow as additional thiols adsorb (Figure 3, Step 2). The  next phase involves the unfolding of alkane chains into their all-trans  configuration, a process 3-4 times slower than the initial coverage phase  (Figure 3, Step 3). This reordering maximises van der Waals interactions  between molecules. Further adsorption of alkanethiols completes the well- packed monolayer (Figure 3, Step 4). Over a period of up to 7 hours, most gauche defects in tail groups disappear, leaving a surface with steps in the  gold, various grain boundaries, and other defects, but with the majority of  alkanethiolate molecules present in the crystalline grains [40].  The formation of such monolayers is based on the strong adsorption of  disulfides (R-S-S-R), sulphides (R-S-R), and thiols (R-SH) onto the Au  surface. The sulphur donor atoms coordinate strongly with the gold surface,  while van der Waals forces between the methylene groups orient and stabilise  the monolayer into an orderly structure [41]. Voltammetric studies have  shown that during adsorption, thiol groups undergo deprotonation [42]. The  assumed equation for the formation of SAM is:  𝑅𝑅−𝑆𝑆−𝐻𝐻+ 𝐴𝐴𝑢𝑢𝑛𝑛0 →𝑅𝑅−𝑆𝑆−𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴+ ∙𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑛𝑛0 + 1 2 �𝐻𝐻2  (1)  Porter et al. demonstrated that alkanethiols with long chains (consisting  of more than 10 methylene groups) assemble in a manner reminiscent of  crystalline structures. Shortening the chain length results in less organised  structures [43]. However, alkanethiols such as 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid  (11-MUA) or 11-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-undecane-1-thiol (PUT) form dense and  stable films, which facilitate the observation of mediated electron transfer  kinetics. SAMs can create a chemical environment that attracts or binds  specific molecules by functionalising the end groups of alkanethiols (e.g., with  carboxyl, amine, or pyrrole groups). These bound molecules might participate  in electron transfer processes, effectively acting as intermediaries between the  analyte and the electrode.  When dealing with ω-functionalized thiols, various chemical moieties  can be strongly bound at the solid-liquid interface, enabling the design of  materials with new surface properties for biomolecule binding [44,45]. Mixed  SAMs, formed by the co-adsorption of two thiols, have been shown to prevent  denaturation and improve the bioactivity of immobilised proteins compared  to pure SAMs [46–48]. Typically, mixed SAMs consist of one thiolate with a  desired functional group (e.g., a carboxylic acid) at a low fraction and another  "diluting" thiolate containing inert functional groups at a high fraction. This  configuration reduces the surface concentration of functional groups,  minimising steric hindrance, partial protein denaturation [46] and non-specific  interactions that can cause interference signals [47].  The nature of functional groups on thiols plays a crucial role in their  interactions with biomolecules. Grazing incidence infrared spectroscopy  reveals that alkane thiols with functional groups like NH2 or OH are tightly  packed, highly oriented, and well-ordered. The monolayer's orientation  remains unaffected when these end groups are small (less than 5 Å). However,

larger groups like COOH reduce packing density and order [49]. In mixed  monolayers of ω-substituted thiols and shorter alkanethiols, the thiols adsorb  in the same proportion as in solution without phase separation, indicating  random ordering [50,51]. This allows for blending ω-substituted alkanethiols  with shorter non-substituted thiols to ensure anchor groups are available for  immobilisation, potentially reducing steric hindrance [52,53]. The SAM  mixture (SAMmix) presented in this dissertation, consisting of 6-mercapto-1- hexanol (6-MCOH) and 11-MUA, provides a precise method for surface  modification with desired functional groups in order to facilitate covalent  biomolecule immobilisation. It also reduces non-specific protein adsorption  on the working electrode surface [54].     For example, during the development of MIP-based glyphosate sensors,  Balciunas et al. [55] investigated the dispersion of glyphosate and its direct  adsorption on the gold surface of the electrochemical surface plasmon  resonance (ESPR) sensor. They suggested a method involving the creation of  a SAM underlayer between the gold and the electrochemically produced MIP  layer in response to the template molecule's strong interaction with the gold  electrode. However, it's noteworthy that the insulating properties of SAM- based underlayers can negatively affect the electrodeposition rate of Ppy,  necessitating careful consideration during sensor development.   1.2.3. The formation of MIPs-aptamer  The use of MIPs as recognition elements has attracted a lot of attention  among the different approaches used in biosensor design with specially  designed binding sites that can precisely and selectively bind target molecules  of interest. You et al. [56] have introduced a novel approach to biosensor  development, demonstrating the preparation of MIP on a glassy carbon  electrode (GCE). In this innovative method, the MIP layer is formed in the  presence of an amyloid-β oligomers (AβO) template molecule, which acts as  an artificial antibody with high specificity for sample matrices. AβO  molecules within the samples can be selectively captured, and non- specifically bound entities can be eliminated by forming a sandwich structure  in conjunction with aptamers. This MIPs-aptamer sandwich biosensor, under  optimal conditions, exhibits exceptional specificity and sensitivity. With the  use of appropriate MIPs and aptamers, this technique can be extended to detect  additional protein biomarkers, thereby presenting a new perspective on MIPs  and aptamers as alternatives to antibodies in biomarker detection [57].  Another innovative approach to biosensor development involves  embedding aptamers in the polymer matrix to act as selective recognition

elements. These polymers with embedded aptamers are specifically  formulated to capture target proteins not by the MIP but rather by the aptamer  embedded in the polymer structure, demonstrating the adaptability and  versatility of this methodology in diverse biosensing applications. This  dissertation also examines such an approach.  1.3.

This enhances biosensor  performance, allowing for more sensitive and selective detection of various  analytes. The following subsections provide information about the analytes  studied in the dissertation. The analyte properties and the electrochemical  detection methods are reviewed.  1.3.1. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria  Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that  thrives at an optimum temperature of 37°C [58], and is a leading cause of  foodborne illness-related mortality [59]. This bacterium is primarily an  environmental contaminant found in soil and can be carried by various  animals, including ruminants, birds, marine life, insects, ticks, and  crustaceans [60]. Listeria monocytogenes can infiltrate the food supply chain,  contaminating a wide range of products, such as meat, raw and unpasteurised  milk and cheeses, ice cream, raw or processed vegetables and fruits,  undercooked poultry, sausages, hot dogs, deli meats, and raw or smoked fish  and seafood [61].  One severe form of illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes can lead to  septicaemia and meningitis, with a case-fatality rate of 20–30% [62]. Another  form is a non-invasive gastrointestinal illness that typically does not have  severe consequences. Despite the relatively low incidence of listeriosis in the  general population, it remains a significant and deadly foodborne disease, with  a hospitalisation rate exceeding 95% [63]. The primary concern is that Listeria  monocytogenes disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, including the  elderly, pregnant women, unborn babies, and immunocompromised  individuals (such as those with cancer or AIDS or those who have undergone  organ transplants) [64]. Pregnant women, for example, have a 17-fold  increased risk of contracting invasive listeriosis [65], and the infection  accounts for 22% of fatalities among immunocompromised adults [61].

Detecting Listeria monocytogenes is critical for healthcare and the food  industry [66]. The minimal infectious dose for listeriosis is 100 colony- forming units per gram (CFU/g) of food. Most countries enforce a zero- tolerance policy for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in food.  According to the European Regulation on Microbiological Criteria for  Foodstuffs, the presence of Listeria monocytogenes is not permitted in foods  intended for infants and certain medical purposes [67]. However, other foods  are allowed to contain up to 100 CFU/g of the bacterium during their shelf  life [68].   The application of MIPs for detecting Listeria monocytogenes bacteria  has shown potential benefits. However, it is noteworthy that only a few studies  have explored the use of electrochemical techniques for this purpose,  suggesting that the field of MIP-based sensors for Listeria monocytogenes  detection is still relatively underdeveloped. For instance, a gold disk electrode  combined with recombinase-assisted amplification-based CRISPR/Cas12a  (RAA-based E-CRISPR) used square wave voltammetry (SWV), achieving a  limit of detection (LOD) of 26 CFU/mL and a linear range from 2.6 × 101 to  2.6 × 109 CFU/mL [69]. Another study employed a gold electrode with a  sandwich assay using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy (EIS), achieving a linear range from 102 to  106 CFU/mL [70]. Multiwalled carbon nanotube electrodes used in an  immunoassay with CV realised a LOD of 1.07 × 102 CFU/mL and a linear  range from 102 to 105 CFU/mL [71]. Additionally, an aluminium disc  electrode used in an immunoassay with EIS had a 1.3 log CFU/mL LOD and  a linear range from 1.3 to 4.3 log CFU/mL [72]. Typically, lysozyme was used  as the enzyme for template extraction during MIP-based sensor development.  1.3.2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   The global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has necessitated an urgent response from public  health authorities. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared  COVID-19 a pandemic on March 12, 2020, following its initial outbreak in  Wuhan, China [73,74]. Since then, numerous virus variants have emerged,  complicating disease management strategies.  SARS-CoV-2 is a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with  a genome of approximately 29.9 kb, making it one of the longest among RNA  viruses [75]. The virus is characterised by its crown-like spikes on the outer  surface, which are crucial for its ability to infect host cells [76]. The genome  of SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins: spike (rS), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (rN) proteins [75]. The E-protein, the  smallest structural protein, is involved in virus formation and maturation. The  M-protein maintains the shape of the viral shell and connects with other  structural proteins [77]. The rN protein is essential for viral replication and  immune modulation, playing a significant role in the virus's life cycle [78]. It  is expressed abundantly in host cells and is less frequently mutated than other  structural proteins, making it a reliable marker for diagnosis and a target for  understanding COVID-19-related inflammation due to its immunogenicity  and role in cytokine storms [79]. The rS protein, a homotrimer, facilitates viral  entry into host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)  receptors via its S1 subunit and mediating membrane fusion through its S2  subunit. The rS protein is a primary focus for diagnostic tools and vaccine  development because of its essential role in viral entry and its high mutation  rate in new variants [80–83].  Initially, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 focused on identifying antibodies  against the rS protein, as the immune response to infection leads to the  production of specific antibodies [84]. Most patients do not develop an  antibody response until the second week following the onset of symptoms,  often allowing for diagnosis based on antibody detection only during the  recovery phase [85]. The rS protein can act as a biorecognition element in  immunosensors by triggering an immune response that leads to the production  of specific antibodies. These antibodies can then be targeted and detected by  the immunosensor, making the rS protein a valuable component for this  purpose [84]. Currently, serologic tests for the presence of antibodies against  SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins are mainly based on standard approaches such as  the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [85] and the lateral flow  immunoassay (LFIA) [86]. Despite their widespread use, immunoanalytical  methods like ELISA and LFIA have notable drawbacks: ELISA is time- consuming, and LFIA is not fully automated. As a result, there is a clear need  for rapid, easy-to-use, and precise testing methods that also allow for  quantitative analysis. Various physical techniques can detect analytical signals  from affinity sensors, including surface plasmon resonance [87], scanning  electrochemical microscopy [88], quartz crystal microbalance [89] and total  internal reflection ellipsometry [90]. Among these, electrochemical  immunosensors stand out due to their advantages of low cost, robustness, and  simplicity in both detection procedures and data interpretation [91]. These  sensors enable the detection of both antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the  nucleocapsid (rN) protein, which plays a crucial role in virus identification.  As SARS-CoV-2 began to mutate, the spike (rS) protein underwent significant  changes, complicating the detection of antibodies due to variations in protein

affinity. In response, the focus can shift to the detection of the rN protein,  which is more abundantly expressed in host cells and less prone to mutations  compared to the rS protein [92,93].   Immunosensors, which had already proven vital due to their sensitivity,  selectivity, and cost-effectiveness, were adapted to detect the rN protein. This  shift enhanced the reliability of viral diagnostics despite the ongoing  mutations of SARS-CoV-2.  1.3.3.  The vascular endothelial growth factor  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein activated in  response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia). It is critical for blood vessel  development during embryogenesis (vasculogenesis) and for the formation of  new blood vessels from existing ones (angiogenesis), processes often  associated with cancer [94]. In mammals, the VEGF family includes five  members: A, B, C, D [95] and placenta growth factor (PLGF) [96]. The most  studied member, VEGFA (commonly referred to as VEGF), has nine  proangiogenic isoforms produced by alternative exon splicing [97], with  VEGF165 being the most common and associated with the growth and  metastasis of various human cancers [98].  Identifying and quantifying disease-related proteins like VEGF are  essential for clinical diagnosis, biological applications, and medical research.  Early detection of VEGF protein biomarkers significantly simplifies cancer  diagnosis and is vital for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment  interventions [99]. Additionally, VEGF has been linked to several human  disorders through blood biomarker analysis, including rheumatoid arthritis  [100], psoriasis [101], and Alzheimer's disease [102]. VEGF detection has  been achieved using various methods, each employing different electrode  materials, polymers, and detection techniques. One approach involves flexible  silk protein matrices combined with a conducting ink containing poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate, creating a biocompatible  platform suitable for antibody immobilisation. This method demonstrates a  moderate LOD of 1.03 pg/mL and a wide linear range from 1 pg/mL to  1 μg/mL [103]. Another method uses a gold screen-printed electrode (SPE)  functionalised with a MIP, synthesised with acrylamide and N,N′- methylenebis (acrylamide) as the monomer and crosslinker, polymerised  around EGFR and VEGF templates. This technique shows a LOD of  0.005 pg/mL and a wide linear range from 0.01 pg/mL to 7000 pg/mL [104].  Additionally, this biosensor underscores the value of multidisciplinary  approaches in protein detection by combining MIP technology, antibody- conjugated nanoliposomes, and electrochemical detection for the sensitive and  selective determination of VEGF. Another method employs poly(o- phenylenediamine) as the polymer matrix on a glassy carbon electrode  modified with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and gold nanoparticles  (AuNPs). Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), this approach achieves  a linear range from 0.5 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL and an LOD of 300 pg/mL [105].  Accurate detection of VEGF is crucial for understanding its role in disease  progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies, offering  significant implications for improving clinical outcomes across various  conditions, including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION  This section details the methodologies employed in developing four  distinct biosensors: (i) a MIP-based biosensor for Listeria monocytogenes  bacteria sensing; (ii) a SAM-based biosensor for detecting antibodies against  the rS protein; (iii) a biosensor integrating SAM-supported MIP for rN protein  detection; and (iv) an DNR-aptamer biosensor for the detection of VEGF  protein. Each biosensor employs a unique strategy for target detection, using  electrochemical techniques to achieve precise and reliable measurements.  2.1. The analytical system used in MIP-based biosensors dedicated to  bacteria sensing  A potential cycling strategy was used to clean the screen-printed carbon  electrodes (SPCE) electrochemically. The electrodes were cleaned in 0.5 M  sulphuric acid using 20 potential cycles in a potential range from –0.1 V to  +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a potential sweep rate of 0.1 V·s-1. Bacteria –  Listeria monocytogenes – were acquired from Sumy State University's  Bacteria Collection (Sumy, Ukraine). To eradicate virulence while  maintaining the antigenic structure on the Listeria monocytogenes membrane,  109 CFU/mL of the bacteria were submerged in 70% ethanol and exposed to  UV light for a full day. This process makes it possible to destroy bacterial  DNA while having little effect on the shape and cell wall, both of which are  essential for the development of MIP.  For  the  MIP  deposition,  several  steps  were  followed:  (i)  electrochemically depositing the Ppy underlayer from a polymerisation  solution with 0.5 M pyrrole using a sequence of 5 potential pulses (+950 mV  for 1 s and 0 V for 30 s), (ii) adding 109 CFU/mL of Listeria monocytogenes  bacteria into the same polymerisation bulk solution during the deposition of  the second layer and repeating the pulse sequence, and (iii) incubating the  electrodes in different extraction solutions (0.05 M sulphuric acid, 10% acetic  acid, 0.1% L-lysine, 10 U/mL trypsin) at 37°C for 30 minutes to remove  imprinted bacteria and form the MIP. The NIP-based layer was formed  similarly to MIP without the addition of bacteria, acting as a control surface.  Pulsed amperometric detection was then employed, using a sequence of 10  potential pulses of +600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl for 2 s, followed by 0 V vs.  Ag/AgCl for 2 s, to assess the MIP and NIP-modified electrodes.

Figure 5. Schematic representation of experimental stages for the SAM-based  biosensor.  2.2.1. The preparation and modification of square gold electrode – Au(s)  The square gold electrode (Au(s)), made of 99.9% chemically pure gold,  had a geometrical area of 2 cm2. To prepare the Au(s) surface, it was first  mechanically polished using an alumina suspension. After polishing, the  electrode was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath (EMAG Emmi-40 HC, Germany)  for 10 min. Following this, the electrode was treated in a 0.5 M NaBH4  solution (H2O/MeOH, v/v, 1:1) [106] for 10 minutes. The Au(s) electrode was  reused after each experiment by repeating this same preparation procedure.  The Au(s) electrode was then used for the formation of an 11-MUA monolayer  (Figure 5, Step 1). The electrode was incubated at 24°C in a 1 mM ethanolic  solution of 11-MUA for 18 hours, then rinsed with ethanol and dried under a  nitrogen flow to create the Au(s)/11-MUA layer. To activate the 11-MUA  monolayer on the Au(s)/11MUA surface, the electrode was treated with a  mixture  of  0.04 M  N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethyl-carbodiimide  hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.01 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in 10 mM  PBS solution for 15 minutes, forming the Au(s)/11-MUA/EDC-NHS layer.  Next, the electrodes were incubated with 1 mL of a 50 µg/mL solution of the  rS protein in 10 mM PBS solution at room temperature for 45 minutes. This  prolonged exposure allowed the rS protein to covalently bind to the activated  Au(s)/11-MUA/EDC-NHS layer through its primary amine groups, forming  the Au(s)/11-MUA/EDC-NHS/rS structure (Figure 5, Step 2). The higher  volume and concentration of the protein solution used on the Au(s) electrode  with 11-MUA were chosen to ensure thorough and effective protein binding  to the surface-modified layer.

2.2.2. The preparation and modification of microscope glass slides coated  with gold (Au(MS))  The 20 x 30 mm microscope slides were cleaned with 2-propanol and  then ultrasonically cleaned using an ultrasonic bath. After ultrasonic cleaning,  the slides were submerged in H2SO4 solution for 30 min. Once removed from  the acid, the slides were dried with a stream of N2 gas (99.99% purity). The  dried slides were placed inside a vacuum magnetron chamber manufactured  by VST Services Ltd. (Israel). Film deposition did not commence until a  vacuum of at least 7·10-8 Torr was achieved. A thin layer of titanium,  approximately 10 nm, was first applied to enhance the adhesion of gold to the  glass surface. This was followed by the application of a 100 nm layer of gold  (Au(MS)). The working electrode geometric area was 0.179 cm2.  Au(MS) electrodes were incubated at 24°C for 4 hours in a 1 mM  solution of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (6-MCOH) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic  acid (11-MUA) in ethanol, using a molar ratio of 9:1, respectively, to form a  mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAMmix) (Figure 5, Step 3). After  incubation, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove any excess of  SAMmix and then dried with a flow of nitrogen gas, forming the  Au(MS)/SAMmix layer on the gold-coated slides. The SAMmix layer on  Au(MS) was activated using a mixture of 0.004 M EDC and 0.001 M NHS in  10 mM PBS solution at room temperature for 15 minutes, resulting in the  Au(MS)/SAMmix/EDC-NHS layer.

2.2.2. The preparation and modification of microscope glass slides coated  with gold (Au(MS))  The 20 x 30 mm microscope slides were cleaned with 2-propanol and  then ultrasonically cleaned using an ultrasonic bath. After ultrasonic cleaning,  the slides were submerged in H2SO4 solution for 30 min. Once removed from  the acid, the slides were dried with a stream of N2 gas (99.99% purity). The  dried slides were placed inside a vacuum magnetron chamber manufactured  by VST Services Ltd. (Israel). Film deposition did not commence until a  vacuum of at least 7·10-8 Torr was achieved. A thin layer of titanium,  approximately 10 nm, was first applied to enhance the adhesion of gold to the  glass surface. This was followed by the application of a 100 nm layer of gold  (Au(MS)). The working electrode geometric area was 0.179 cm2.  Au(MS) electrodes were incubated at 24°C for 4 hours in a 1 mM  solution of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (6-MCOH) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic  acid (11-MUA) in ethanol, using a molar ratio of 9:1, respectively, to form a  mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAMmix) (Figure 5, Step 3). After  incubation, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove any excess of  SAMmix and then dried with a flow of nitrogen gas, forming the  Au(MS)/SAMmix layer on the gold-coated slides.

Following the activation step, the  electrodes were treated with 70 µL of 100 µg/mL of rS protein in 10 mM PBS  solution  at  room  temperature  for  minutes,  forming  the  Au(MS)/SAMmix/EDC-NHS/rS structure (Figure 5, Step 4). The electrodes  were treated with a 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 30 minutes  to deactivate any remaining reactive esters. Following this, 100 µL of an anti- rS antibody solution in 10 mM PBS solution was added to the electrode at  concentrations ranging from 30 to 150 nM for 45 minutes at room  temperature, forming the Au(MS)/SAMmix/EDC-NHS/rS/anti-rS complex  (Figure 5, Step 5).

electrochemical cell. All experiments, before and after each incubation step,  were carried out in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with the addition of 2 mM [Fe3(CN)6]  and 2 mM [Fe4(CN)6] as a redox probe ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−). The three-electrode  system comprised the Au-based electrode (Au(s) or Au(MS)) as the working  electrode, platinum (Pt) wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl in  saturated KCl (Ag/AgCl(KClsat)) microelectrode (ISAG/AGCL.AQ.RE) as the  reference electrode (ItalSens, The Netherlands).  Electrochemical characterisation of Au(s) and Au(MS) electrodes at  different modification steps was performed using CV and EIS methods. CV  measurements were conducted in the potential range from −0.2 to +0.6 V for  Au(MS) electrode and 0 to +0.4 V for Au(s) vs Ag/AgCl(KClsat) at a scan rate  of 50 mV·s−1.

Subsequently, similar to the procedures used for the detecting bacteria,  the Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) electrodes underwent a washing step to remove  the rN protein, resulting in the formation of a MIP structure with  complementary cavities to the original template (Figure 6, Step 2).

protein and a redox probe throughout this incubation period. For  electrochemical measurements, 2.5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− was added to a 0.1 M  PBS solution at pH 7.4. The working electrode underwent electrochemical  characterisation using EIS and square wave voltammetry (SWV) at various  stages of modification. EIS measurements were recorded at open circuit  potential (OCP) with a 10 mV amplitude over a frequency range from  100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Experiments with SWV were conducted with a step size  of 4 mV, square wave frequency of 20 Hz, and a pulse height of 50 mV in the  potential range from – 0.4 V to +0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. All experiments were  performed at room temperature (20 °C). Two different systems were  employed to evaluate the EIS data. Initially, the Randles equivalent circuit  was used with Rs representing dynamic solution resistance, Cdl representing  double layer capacitance between electrode and electrolyte solution, Rct  representing charge transfer resistance, and Zw representing the Warburg  diffusion element (Figure 6). The second system was employed using EEC (Rs  + Cdl/Rct + C2/R3), which is composed of three components connected in series  (Figure 6). The first component, Rs, expresses electrolyte resistance. The  parallel elements Cdl and Rct, associated with the first Nyquist semi-circle,  correspond to the constant phase element (CPE) and the charge transfer  resistance. For the second Nyquist semi-circle, the parallel elements C2 and  R3 represent CPE and charge transfer resistance, respectively.  2.4. The analytical system used for the development of an aptamer- based biosensor for the detection of VEGF protein  The hybridisation of oligonucleotides, specifically the anti-VEGF aptamer,  involves several steps to assemble the desired structure. The anti-VEGFA SL2B  aptamer sequence, highlighted in Table 1, is critical for this process. Additional  DNA sequences are designed to form a stem (stalk) structure following  oligonucleotide hybridisation (Figure 7). Initially, the thiol-modified  oligonucleotide (stalkGTG) undergoes reduction before aptamer assembly. This  reduction involves treating the disulfide bond of the 3’-thiol modifier using a  standard protocol. The thiol-modified oligonucleotide is first dissolved in 125 µL  of dithiothreitol solution (100 mM DTT in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH  8.3) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, any by- products are removed using a Sephadex® G-25 column (NAP-10, 'Cytiva'). Once  reduced, hybridisation of the oligonucleotides occurs, assembling the aptamer by  mixing equal volumes of normalised oligonucleotide solutions (combSL2B,  stalkGTG, and r_stalkGTG) at a concentration of 30 pM/µL in PBS buffer. This  mixture is then boiled in a water bath for 5 minutes before being slowly cooled to  room temperature. Figure  7.  Self-assembling  anti-VEGF  aptamer  based  on  three  oligonucleotides.

Before  modification with a polymer layer, the SPCE electrodes underwent  electrochemical cleaning through cyclic voltammetry. This involved  immersing the electrodes in a 0.5 M sulfuric acid solution and cycling the  potential for 20 cycles at a sweep rate of 0.1 V/s within a potential range of – 0.1 V to +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The polymer layer was deposited using a two- step electrochemical polymerisation procedure (Figure 8). In the first step, a  Ppy underlayer was electrochemically deposited from a solution containing  0.1 M pyrrole in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, by applying a sequence of 5 potential  pulses (+0.95 V for 1 s followed by 0 V for 30 s). In the second step, the anti- VEGF aptamer was added to the same polymerisation solution, and the  sequence of 5 potential pulses was repeated. This process embeds the anti- VEGF aptamer within the Ppy structure, enhancing the stability and support  of the aptamer molecule. Pulsed Amperometric Detection (PAD) was  employed to evaluate the Ppy-modified DNR-aptamer electrodes. The  detection sequence consisted of 10 potential pulses of +600 mV vs Ag/AgCl  for 2 seconds, followed by 0 V vs Ag/AgCl for 2 seconds.    Figure 8.

3.1.1. The electrodeposition of MIP and extraction of imprinted bacteria  The Ppy and Ppy+bacteria layers were electrochemically deposited onto  SPCE electrodes using a series of potential pulses (Figure 9). Figures 9 A  and D illustrate the potential pulse series profiles for the deposition of the Ppy  layer on SPCE electrodes. The electrochemical formation of the Ppy+bacteria  layer on SPCE electrodes was conducted in multiple steps, as detailed in the  experimental section (Figure 4). Initially, a Ppy-based underlayer was  electrodeposited to support and cover the electrode, reducing the direct  interaction of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria with the electrode surface  before forming the Ppy+bacteria sensing layer. This thin Ppy underlayer  facilitated the subsequent formation of the Ppy+bacteria sensing layer. During  the second step, Listeria monocytogenes bacteria were entrapped as templates  within an upper Ppy layer (sensing layer), which, after bacteria removal,  constituted the MIP layer. The electrochemical deposition of Ppy enabled  precise control over the thickness of the formed layers and effective  entrapment of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria within the electropolymerised  matrix.   The entrapped bacteria were removed from the Ppy+bacteria layer by  incubating the electrodes in various extraction solutions, resulting in the final  MIP imprint. The first extraction method involved incubating Ppy and  Ppy+bacteria electrodes with an acetic acid solution, as shown in Figures 10 A  and B. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of this process reveal the  effectiveness of acetic acid in removing the bacteria. Acetic acid, a weak  organic acid toxic to most bacteria even at concentrations as low as 0.5 wt%,  disrupts bacterial cells by lowering intracellular pH and interfering with  metabolic processes through its anion [107]. The SEM images vividly  demonstrate the efficacy of acetic acid, which creates holes in the bacterial  cell membranes, allowing cytosol and organelles to leak out. This results in  rough, uneven pits on the cell surfaces, confirming the high effectiveness of  this method. In contrast, when Ppy and Ppy+bacteria electrodes were  incubated in a sulfuric acid solution, the surfaces of the electrodes remained  unchanged, as depicted in Figures 10 C and D.  The third method investigated for extracting the Listeria monocytogenes  bacterial template from the Ppy+bacteria involved using a trypsin enzyme  solution. Trypsin, a well-known pancreatic enzyme, functions by hydrolysing  peptide bonds, specifically at the C-terminal of arginine (Arg) and lysine (Lys)  residues, leading to the breakdown of proteins into peptides [108]. Figure 9. Electrochemical deposition of Ppy and Ppy+bacteria layers. The  current profiles shown for the deposition of the Ppy layer on SPCE electrodes  demonstrate the changes in current during the formation of the Ppy layer from  a polymerisation solution that does not contain bacteria (A). Current profiles  were registered during the electrochemical deposition of Ppy layers, Ppy  underlayer (B), and Ppy+bacteria sensing layer with entrapped Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria on SPCE electrodes (C). Insets (D – F) display an  extended current profile during the indicated potential pulse. In this study, trypsin effectively hydrolysed cell wall proteins, aiding in the  removal of bacterial cells from the Ppy-based matrices. Notably, trypsin only  targets specific areas of the cell wall and does not affect the Ppy layer, making  it an ideal candidate for the selective removal of bacteria without damaging  the underlying polymer structure. This characteristic is particularly useful for  developing MIP-based sensor platforms. Comparative results (Figure 10 F)  indicated that the trypsin-based extraction method was more efficient than  other methods tested. Previous studies have highlighted the role of proteolytic  enzymes like trypsin in bacterial lysis, with increased enzyme activity  observed in inflammatory sites. For example, Grenier demonstrated that  Gram-positive bacteria in the oral cavity exhibit greater resistance to lysis than  Gram-negative bacteria [109]. Zhou et al. further showed that a concentration  of 2 mg/mL trypsin had similar effects on both bacterial types, including  biofilm formation [110]. The research revealed that a 10 U/mL trypsin  solution is the most efficient method for removing Listeria monocytogenes  cells from the Ppy layer and forming MIP. Notably, trypsin only targets  specific areas of the cell wall and does not affect the Ppy layer, making it  particularly useful for eliminating bacteria-based templates and creating MIP- based sensor platforms.  L-lysine, a zwitterionic amino acid, was also tested for its ability to  dissociate and remove bacteria from Ppy-based matrices. As an amino acid  and a zwitterion at pH = 7.0, L-lysine is expected to be more effective than  trypsin in dissociating or removing certain compounds from polymeric  structures. A comparison of the results (Figure 10 H) indicated that the  trypsin-based extraction method was more effective than the L-lysine  extraction method. Additionally, L-lysine plays a role in protein synthesis and  is found in the peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive cell walls of bacteria,  aiding cell metabolism. This property highlights its significance in bacterial  structure and function, although, in this context, the trypsin method proved  superior for removing Listeria monocytogenes from the Ppy layer.

3.1.2. Electrochemical characterisation for bacteria-imprinted MIP layer  The NIP and MIP sensors were evaluated using pulsed amperometric  detection, which measures current density in a series of 10 potential pulses of  +600 mV for 2 s and 0 mV for 2 s. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria at  concentrations ranging from 3.4 × 106 to 1.0 × 108 CFU/mL were incubated  in a pH 7.4 PBS solution using SPCE electrodes modified with MIP and NIP.  As the bacteria concentration increased, the amperometric response  decreased, a common trend for redox-inactive analytes [111].   The effectiveness of various extraction solutions was assessed, including  10% acetic acid (Figure 11 A), 0.05 M sulfuric acid (Figure 11 B), 10 U/mL  trypsin (Figure 11 C), and 0.1% L-lysine (Figure 11 D). For acetic acid, the  current density of MIP was at least 12 times higher than that of NIP, indicating  that it was highly effective, as shown in Figure 10. The current density barely  changed when using the sulfuric acid solution. However, Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria have an acid tolerance, a predicted molecular  response that keeps the cells alive in an unfavourable environment.  Morphological techniques confirmed the increased intracellular survival and  the development of acid-adapted Listeria monocytogenes cells in the  cytoplasm and vacuoles [112]. Various strategies were employed to address  the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria acid-tolerance response. One approach  involved using the enzyme trypsin to enhance the extraction process. Using  this technique, the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria were effectively removed  from the NIP and MIP layers (Figure 11 C). Finally, L-lysine (Figure 11 D)  solutions were also tested. Trypsin-treated MIP exhibited a current density  approximately three times higher than NIP, while L-lysine-treated MIP  showed no change in current density. Electrochemical results indicated that  electrical capacitance varied after removing the imprinted bacteria, with  trypsin and acetic acid proving to be the most effective solution for releasing  trapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and forming the MIP.

Figure 11. The current density of electrodes of NIP (solid black lines) and  MIP (dashed red lines) was registered using PAD after incubation in solutions  containing varying concentrations of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The  bacteria were extracted using different solutions: 10% acetic acid (A), 0.05 M  H2SO4 (B), 10 U/mL trypsin (C), and 0.1% L-lysine (D).  3.1.3. Determination of the limit of detection, the limit of quantification  and the imprinting factor  The efficiency of trypsin solution in extracting entrapped Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria from the Ppy-based layer to form MIP was  confirmed. Although both acetic acid and trypsin were effective extraction  solutions, trypsin was ultimately preferred due to the acid tolerance of Listeria  monocytogenes, which could diminish the effectiveness of acetic acid for  application in real world diagnostics, where acid tolerant bacteria can be  found. Electrochemical measurements based on PAD were performed to  determine the LOD and LOQ (Equations 2 and 3). Analytical signals were  represented by ΔI values for NIP and MIP, respectively. Figure 12 illustrates  Listeria monocytogenes bacteria concentration calibration curves plotted  against ΔI (µA). The slope of the change in current (ΔI, µA) versus the  concentration of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria (expressed in CFU/mL)  recorded by the NIP electrode was 0.016 µA/(CFU/mL), with an R2 value of  0.98. Conversely, the linear regression slope for the Listeria monocytogenes  bacteria-imprinted MIP was 0.063 µA/(CFU/mL), with an R2 value of 0.97. Figure 12. Calibration curve ΔI registered by MIP (black line) and NIP (red  line) vs. Listeria monocytogenes concentration. Error bars are expressed as the  standard deviation of the sample.  Molecular imprinting is ranked according to the relationship between the  MIP and the NIP, which is obtained according to Equation (4) [113,114]:  𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼= 𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁   (4)  Usually, IF is called an imprinting factor, whereas Ayerdurai et al. [115]  argued that an apparent imprinting factor is a more correct term for IF. The  results showed that, compared to the NIP electrode, the MIP had an apparent  imprinting factor towards the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria that was  roughly 3.93. If the value of IF exceeds 1, it indicates a high degree of  molecular imprinting and strong specificity for the target analyte [113]. The  LOD and the LOQ were calculated according to Equations (2) and (3). It was  evaluated that the LOD and LOQ for the MIP were 70 CFU/mL and  210 CFU/mL, respectively, in the linear range from 300 to 6700 CFU/mL.

3.2. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 rS using SAM-based  detection method   This section explores the use of SAM to modify gold electrodes in order  to enable the construction of a biosensor used for detecting antibodies against  the SARS-CoV-2 rS protein. The study builds on the principles of EIS and CV  to evaluate the performance of these SAM-based systems. The approach  involves understanding how SAMs, particularly mixed SAMs (SAMmix),  influence the surface properties and electron transfer characteristics of  electrode surfaces.  The section is divided into two main parts. First, subsection 3.2.1  discusses the evaluation of SAM layers using EIS, including the use of  tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) as model systems to assess SAM  stability, defect density, and electron transfer properties. This foundational  analysis provides insights into how SAM and mixed SAM systems behave in  terms of surface modification and electrochemical performance.  In subsection 3.2.2, the focus shifts to the direct functionalisation and  electrochemical characterisation of modified gold electrode surfaces. Gold  electrodes, including square gold electrodes (Au(s)) and gold-coated  microscopic slides (Au(MS)), are modified with SAMs and SAMmix systems.  The electrochemical behaviour of these modified electrodes is characterised  before and after surface treatments, providing detailed insights into their role  in enhancing sensor detection capabilities.  3.2.1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based evaluation of SAM  and tethered bilayer lipid membranes layers  While the formation and characteristics of these monolayers have been  widely studied on various substrates, including gold electrodes, the present  study also includes the use of SAMmix systems. These SAMmix systems,  when evaluated using tBLMs, demonstrate reduced defect density and  improved stabilisation of electron transfer. This indicates that such an  approach could enhance biosensing performance by ensuring better control  over the structural integrity of the modified electrode surface. The detailed  electrochemical analysis and impedance behaviour of both SAM and tBLM  layers provide a crucial foundation for understanding the surface  modifications that will be further explored in the following section for the  design of a biosensor.  The Au(MS) were incubated for 3 hours in an ethanolic solution  containing 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (βME) and 20-tetradecyloxy- 3,6,9,12,15,18,22-heptaoxahexatricontane-1-thiol (WC14) in a molar ratio of  65:35. This incubation allowed the formation of a Au(MS)/SAMmix,  composed of βME as a backfiller and synthetic thiolipid WC14 molecules.  Figure 13 A illustrates the typical changes in the EIS spectra following  the formation of a tBLM on an anchor SAMmix. Specifically, the semicircle  of the complex capacitance decreased by approximately tenfold, from  8 μF·cm2 before vesicle fusion and membrane formation to 0.6–0.8 μF·cm2  after tBLM formation. This decrease is attributed to the creation of a dielectric  layer around 3 nm thick [116].  In this study, we examined two lipid compositions of tBLMs capable of  incorporating chlorophyll-a. The EIS data enabled verification of tBLM  integrity across different lipid ratios. The base composition consisted of  DOPC and cholesterol (Chol) in a 6:4 molar ratio. Chl-a was introduced in  two stages: first, replacing some DOPC to achieve a 5:4:1 molar composition  of DOPC/Chol/Chl-a; then, cholesterol was replaced to create a 6:3:1 molar  ratio. Across the various DOPC, Chol, and Chl-a ratios—ranging from 6:4 to  5:4:1 and 6:3:1—only slight changes in tBLM capacitance were observed,  which were not statistically significant (Figure 13 C). However, if the  defectiveness is analysed, the inclusion of Chl-a into DOPC/Chol tBLMs was  found to be an important factor in determining the defect densities in tBLMs.  The algorithm described in [117], was used to estimate the defect densities in  tBLMs with and without Chl-a. The algorithm relates defect density in  membranes with the position of the phase minima in the negative of  impedance phase vs frequency plots. The Equation 5 was used to calculate  approximate densities is:  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑≈ 0.93𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙−0.2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙0 −𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  (5)  where Ndef the defect density in μm−2, fmin the frequency of the negative of  phase minimum, Hz, k = 1.6·10−6 cm2·s −1, r0 = 1 nm and const = 1.24, one  obtains the approximate values of defect densities in tBLMs of different  composition. The calculated according to Equation 5 defect densities are  0.87 ± 0.09 μm−2  for  DOPC/Chol  (6:4),  0.73 ± 0.08 μm−2  for  DOPC/Chol/Chl-a (6:3:1) and 0.16 ± 0.08 μm−2 for DOPC/Chol/Chl-a  tBLMs.  As shown in Figure 2D, the introduction of Chl-a significantly reduced  defectiveness, particularly in the 5:4:1 DOPC/Chol/Chl-a composition, where  defect density was six times lower than that of the base DOPC/Chol (6:4)  composition, and lower compared to the 6:3:1 mixture. This sharp reduction  in defects for the 5:4:1 composition may be due to the combined destabilising effects of cholesterol and Chl-a, as cholesterol’s conical shape destabilises  defects in highly curved bilayer fragments like transient pores, while Chl-a’s  inverted cone shape likely contributes to further destabilization. Together,  these effects enhance bilayer stiffness by forming complementary pairs with  cholesterol.  Interestingly, the defect density was lower in the DOPC/Chol/Chl-a  (6:3:1) mixture, underscoring the importance of the total concentration of  Chol and Chl-a in influencing membrane properties. Overall, Chl-a was found  to induce a significant decrease in tBLM capacitance, likely due to its lower  relative dielectric constant compared to the dioleoyl fragment in DOPC.  However, substituting cholesterol with Chl-a did not result in a similar  magnitude of decrease, suggesting that Chl-a and Chol have comparable  dielectric properties. Another key effect of Chl-a incorporation was a  significant reduction in membrane defectiveness, especially when the total  content of Chol and Chl-a reached 50% of the membrane lipid composition.

various components tBLM structures (D). Bias potential 0 V vs  Ag/AgCl/NaClsat.  However, in the subsequent stages of this study, the focus shifts away from  the use of tBLMs as the investigation moves towards the application of  different SAM systems for direct functionalisation of gold electrodes. These  SAMs, particularly the SAMmix on Au(MS), will be evaluated independently  using electrochemical techniques, allowing for a more focused examination  of their role in enhancing detection capabilities in biosensing platforms. The  detailed characterisation of these SAM layers is key to understanding the  modifications and their direct impact on electrode performance, as presented  in the next section.  3.2.2. The electrochemical characterisation of a modified gold electrode  surface  Building upon these insights, the following study employs similar SAM- based approaches, applying them to gold electrodes enabling the creation of  immunosensor used for the detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2  rS protein. Electrochemical techniques, including CV and EIS, were used to  probe the modifications and their impact on the electrode surfaces. Both  square gold electrodes (Au(s)) and gold-coated microscopic slides (Au(MS))  were characterised before and after surface treatments.  Initially, the Au(s) electrode was modified with an 11-MUA, forming a  SAM. The [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox couple was used to probe the influence of  these modifications on electrode conductivity through changes in oxidation  and reduction peaks in the cyclic voltammogram. The formation of the  11‑MUA SAM resulted in a stable and well-organised monolayer, acting as  an ionic insulator on the gold electrode. This SAM, characterised by a low  defect rate and high fractional coverage, obstructed the electron transfer  pathway, leading to a substantial reduction in the current response, as shown  in Figure 14 A. Figure 14. Cyclic voltammograms of the Au(s) electrode (A) and Au(MS)  electrode (B). Potential scans range from 0 to +0.4 V (A) and from −0.2 to  +0.6 V (B) at 50 mV·s−1 vs Ag/AgCl(KClsat).   For the Au(MS) electrode, a mixed SAM (SAMmix) consisting of  6‑MCOH and 11-MUA was applied. The SAMmix was designed to maintain  stability while allowing redox mediator access to the electrode surface,  reducing pinholes and structural defects. The cyclic voltammogram for the  unmodified Au (MS) electrode (Figure 14 B) showed typical redox behaviour  with a peak current density of 712.4 ± 5.9 μA·cm−2. After the formation of the  SAMmix, the peak current density decreased to 504.6 ± 19.3 μA·cm−2,  indicating restricted electron transfer due to the mixed SAM layer. EDC-NHS  activation of the terminal carboxyl groups caused a slight increase in current  density to 513.1 ± 6.6 μA·cm−2, suggesting enhanced electron transfer.  However, the subsequent immobilisation of rS protein led to a further decrease  in current density to 459.6 ± 9.3 μA·cm−2, attributed to the additional barrier  formed by the protein layer.  EIS measurements provided detailed insight into the changes in charge  transfer resistance (Rct) associated with each modification step. As depicted in  Figure 15 A, the Rct of the Au(s) electrode increased significantly with the  formation of the 11-MUA SAM, reaching 10.6 ± 0.2 kΩ·cm2. This increase is  attributed to the insulating nature of the SAM, which obstructs the movement  of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- ions and hinders electron transfer at the electrode interface.  Activating the 11-MUA carboxyl groups with EDC and NHS resulted in a  reduced Rct of 5.67 ± 0.09 kΩ·cm2, likely due to the formation of an  electrochemically active ester, facilitating electron transfer. The subsequent  immobilisation of rS protein increased Rct to 12.3 ± 0.27 kΩ·cm2, as the  protein layer adds another barrier to electron transfer.   In contrast, the modifications of Au(MS) electrode showed a different  pattern of Rct changes, as illustrated in Figure 15B. The Rct for the unmodified Au(MS) electrode was 98.2 ± 1.2 Ω·cm2, which increased to 803 ± 10 Ω·cm2  with the formation of the SAMmix. This increase, although significant, is  lower than the Rct for the Au(s) with the 11-MUA SAM, likely due to the  different composition and properties of the SAMmix, which allows some  electron transfer while still providing a barrier. Following activation with  EDC and NHS, the Rct decreased, likely due to the formation of an  electrochemically active ester that facilitated electron transfer. However, the  subsequent immobilisation of the rS protein caused the Rct to rise again to  1202 ± 23 Ω·cm², as the protein layer added another barrier to electron  transfer (Table 2).  It was observed that the Rct of the NHS and EDC-activated either  Au(s)/11-MUA or Au(MS)/SAMmix electrodes substantially decreased  compared to its value before activation. The activation process involving EDC  and NHS results in the formation of an intermediate electrochemically active  ester due to the interaction between the terminal carboxyl (-COOH) groups  and EDS and NHS. The increase in Rct following the binding of rS is attributed  to the poor electrical conductivity of most proteins at low frequencies, which  impedes charge transfer at the electrode-solution interface. These EIS data are  consistent with previous studies, which used Total Internal Reflection  Ellipsometry to evaluate the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and  their specific antibodies. Those studies demonstrated significant increases in  protein layer thickness and changes in dielectric properties occurring at the  electrode-solution interface [118].   The observed differences in Rct between the Au(s) and Au(MS) systems  are primarily due to the nature of the surface modifications and the specific  characteristics of the SAM layers. The 11-MUA SAM on the Au (s) electrode  forms a highly insulating layer with minimal defects, leading to a significant  increase in Rct. In contrast, the SAMmix on the Au (MS) electrode, while still  increasing Rct, allows for electron transfer due to its composition and structure.    Figure 15.

The initial 11-MUA  SAM provided a stable and insulating layer, while the SAMmix, EDC-NHS  activation, and protein immobilisation introduced progressive changes in  electron transfer characteristics. This comprehensive characterisation  underscores the importance of each modification stage in tailoring the surface  properties of gold electrodes for specific electrochemical applications. In later  experiments targeting antibody detection against the rS protein, the 11-MUA  SAM was not used due to its high Rct and insulating properties, which hindered  electron transfer. Instead, the SAMmix system was adopted for its balanced  stability and efficient electron transmission, significantly enhancing the  sensitivity and effectiveness of the antibody detection process.  3.2.3. The analytical characterisation of immunosensor dedicated for anti-rS  detection  The affinity interaction between anti-rS antibodies and immobilised rS  proteins was studied by sequentially incubating the working electrode surface  with varying concentrations of anti-rS in a 10 mM PBS solution, starting at 30 nM and increasing up to 150 nM through successive dilutions of a stock  solution (Figure 16). EIS measurements were performed in PBS, 7.4,  containing 2 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, using previously detailed parameters. As  anti-rS interacts with immobilised rS, an immune complex forms,  progressively insulating the electrode surface. This reduces the flow of  [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− to the electrode, leading to a stepwise decrease in the redox  current. Notably, at lower anti-rS concentrations (0−90 nM), the current  densities decrease more rapidly, whereas at higher concentrations  (90−150 nM), the process approaches saturation. This is reflected in the  Nyquist plots, where the semicircle radius increases with anti-rS  concentration, indicating increased Rct. EIS data shows a significant increase  in the semicircle radius at lower concentrations (0−90 nM), which slows down  at higher concentrations (90−150 nM). As the concentration of anti-rS  increases, the number of unoccupied rS sites decreases, resulting in a plateau  effect in Rct values at higher concentrations. Table 3 summarises the signal  values obtained from EIS, showing the increase in Rct levels off at higher anti- rS concentrations.  Table 3. Analytical parameters obtained from EIS.

concentration (B). Error bars are expressed as the standard deviation of the  sample. EIS measurements were performed from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, at 10 mV  amplitude and applied potential 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl(KClsat) in PBS, pH 7.4, while  adding 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, signal normalised to the area of the electrode,  A = 0.179 cm2.  To evaluate the analytical characteristics of the electrochemical  immunosensor, LOD and LOQ for sensing anti-rS were calculated from data  gathered using EIS measurements (Equations 2 and 3). As a signal, the Rct  value was obtained from fitting EIS data using Randles equivalent circuit. As  a result, the immunosensor for anti-rS detection using EIS based on the Rct  value had a LOD of 2.78 nM and LOQ of 9.17 nM.  3.3. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein using the SAM- supported MIP detection method  In the case of of Listeria monocytogenes sensor, a Ppy-based underlayer  was electrodeposited to minimise the direct interaction of electrode surface  with the bacteria (Chapter 3.1.). This thin Ppy underlayer facilitated the  subsequent formation of the MIP sensing layer. However, for this study the  SAM was adopted as an underlayer because it offers enhanced performance  and a more controlled surface for the sensor development. SAMs provide a  robust interface between the Au(SPE) surface and the polymer layers, which  is crucial for biosensor applications [119]. Particularly in biosensors, the  stability of the conducting polymer layer on the electrode is critical for long- term performance. To improve the stability and interaction between the  Au(SPE) surface and the Ppy layer, pyrrolyl-terminated alkanethiol (PUT)  was introduced to form the SAM. Acting as a bridge, this SAM creates a  transition system between the SAM and the Ppy film. Previous studies have  shown that strong dipole-dipole interactions between the pyrrolyl end groups  contribute to the formation of the PUT SAM [55]. The polymerisation reaction  between the pyrrolyl-terminated alkanethiol in the SAM and the pyrrole  molecules in the polymerisation solution was expected to enhance the stability  of the Ppy film formed on the gold electrode.  3.3.1. Electrochemical characterisation of Au(SPE) surface modified by  SAMs  The SWV and EIS methods were used to characterise the Au(SPE) and  Au(SPE)/SAM electrodes using a [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− couple as a redox probe.

analysis of oxidation peaks in square wave voltammograms (Figure 17 A) led  to research into the impact of surface modifications on the electrical  conductivity of the working electrode. The Au(SPE)/SAM electrode had a  significant decrease in peak current density from 2.63 ± 0.21 to  1.06 ± 0.09 mA·cm−2 compared to the bare Au(SPE) electrode. Furthermore,  the Nyquist plots were an efficient tool for monitoring impedimetric  characteristics and conducting theoretical analysis of impedance properties  (Figure 17 B). Using an analogous circuit provided insights into chemical  transformations and processes on the conductive electrode surface.  Figure 17 B shows the redox probe's response regarding imaginary impedance  (−Zim) and real impedance (Zre). The Randles equivalent circuit was used to  evaluate EIS data (Figure 17 B). The studied frequency range was 100 kHz to  0.1 Hz. The development of the Au(SPE)/SAM resulted in a charge transfer  resistance (Rct) increase almost tenfold from 5.48 ± 0.07 to 47.5 ± 0.9 Ω·cm2.    Figure 17. Square wave voltammograms (A) and Nyquist plot (B) of Au(SPE)  and Au(SPE)/SAM electrodes. SWV and EIS measurements were performed  in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with 2.5 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. SWV: step size of  4 mV, frequency of 20 Hz, and a pulse height of 50 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in the  potential range from –0.2 V to +0.6 V. EIS was registered at open circuit  potential (OCP) in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, with an  amplitude of 10 mV.  3.3.2. Electrodeposition of MIP- and NIP-based layers  SWV  was  used  to  evaluate  the  Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy  and  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) electrodes in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− as a  redox probe (Figure 18 A). The SWV analysis indicated electrode features  following Ppy electropolymerisation, most notably a drop in current intensity  associated with oxidation peak. The square wave voltammogram for the  Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy electrode exhibited a higher peak current compared to the  SPE/SAM/(Ppy+rN) electrode. This increased current is attributed to the lower thickness of the Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy electrode. After extracting the  template from SPE/SAM/(Ppy+rN), the redox peak increased significantly  (0.44 ± 0.03 mA·cm−2), surpassing SPE/SAM/NIP (0.19 ± 0.06 mA·cm−2),  showing the presence of imprinted cavities that enhance charge transfer.

Square wave voltammograms (A) of Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy (—),  Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP  (− − −),  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN)  (− ∙ −)  and  Au(SPE)//SAM/MIP (− ∙ ∙ −) electrodes, Nyquist plot (B) and Inset in (B):  enlarged view of the Nyquist plot for detailed analysis. SWV and EIS  measurements were performed in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with 2.5 mM of  [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. SWV: step size of 4 mV, frequency of 20 Hz, and a pulse  height of 50 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in the potential range from 0 V to +0.6 V. EIS  was registered at open circuit potential (OCP) in the frequency range from  100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, with an amplitude of 10 mV.  EIS was used to further characterise the Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy and  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) electrodes, using the identical redox probe  ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−) (Figure 18 B). The EIS data were fitted using an equivalent  electrical circuit (EEC), and the best optimal fit was obtained with EEC (Rs +  Cdl/Rct + C2/R3), which included three serial components. Rs represented  electrolyte resistance, while the first Nyquist semi-circle was determined by  parallel components Cdl and Rct, which represented the constant phase element  (CPE) and charge transfer resistance, respectively. The second Nyquist semi- circle included parallel parts C2 and R3, which represented CPE and charge  transfer resistance, respectively. This circuit model successfully characterises  porous structures. Cdl and C2 are viewed as non-ideal capacitances influenced  by surface features. The relation between these constant phase elements (CPE)  and the impedance (Z) is given by Equation 6: 𝑍𝑍𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶= 𝑄𝑄(𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗)𝑛𝑛  (6)  where j is the imaginary number, ω is the angular frequency and n is the  correction factor (0 < n < 1). If the value n tends to 0, the CPE becomes less  capacitive [120,121]. The selection of the equivalent circuit depended upon  the fitting of the Nyquist plot to produce the lowest error.  Removing the nucleocapsid template from SPE/SAM/(Ppy+rN) resulted  in increased electron transport and lower impedance (Figure 14 B). This  resulted in a change in the EEC from the prior model (Rs + Cdl/Rct + C2/R3) to  the Randles equivalent circuit, which reflects enhanced electron transfer  dynamics due to altered surface morphology. While changes in the Nyquist  plot were not apparent after template removal, the Bode plot (Figure 19)  provided more insight into these dynamics. The shift to the Randles circuit  was more evident in the Bode plot, providing a better understanding of  electron transport variations caused by cavity introduction on the electrode  surface.

Furthermore,  comparing  Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy  and  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) post-template extraction found that the EEC for  Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP electrode remained consistent with the two-semicircle  model, indicating minor changes in electrochemical properties. This  emphasises the specificity of molecular imprinting in SPE/SAM/MIP and its  impact on sensor surface electrochemical behaviour and selectivity. After  template extraction, Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP had a greater charge transfer  resistance  (Rct = 1975 ± 9 Ω∙cm2)  than  Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP  (Rct = 879 ± 3 Ω∙cm2) due to imprinted cavities that promote electron transfer.  The SWV and EIS results were further confirmed by SEM micrographs  of the comparative surfaces of the Au(SPE) electrode and the modified  Au(SPE)/SAM electrode with Ppy (Figure 20). The SEM micrograph of the  bare Au(SPE) electrode (Figure 20 A) showed round bulges. In contrast, the  SEM micrograph of the Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP electrode (Figure 20 B) displayed  a distinctive asphalt-like appearance, indicating a transformation in surface  morphology. Furthermore, the SEM micrograph of the Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP  electrode (Figure 20 C) revealed the presence of cavities on the surface,  indicating the successful creation of MIP and contributing to a unique and  tailored topography.    Figure 20. SEM micrographs of Au(SPE) electrode (A), Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP  (B) and Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP (C) electrode surface.  3.3.3. Electrochemical characterisation and detection of the rN protein  The ability of the biosensor to detect the rN protein was tested using a  series of electrochemical experiments. Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP electrodes were  incubated for 5 minutes with rN protein concentrations ranging from 0 to  35 nM in a 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, solution containing [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−.  Impedance responses were investigated for Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP and  Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP modified electrodes. As the rN protein concentration  increased, the Rct for Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP electrodes also increased. In  contrast, the Rct for Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP electrodes remained constant,  demonstrating the molecularly imprinted layer selectivity compared to its non- imprinted counterpart. Additionally, SWV measurements were performed after the incubations. The voltammograms showed a gradual narrowing of the  potential window from 0.2 V to 0.5 V, accompanied by a corresponding  decrease in current density. The current density values decreased from  0.44 ± 0.03 mA·cm−2 in the solution with 0 nM of rN protein to  0.278 ± 0.063 mA·cm−2 in the solution with 35 nM (Figure 18).   SWV and EIS electrochemical measurements were used to determine the  LOD and LOQ (Figure 21). SPE/SAM/NIP and SPE/SAM/MIP electrodes  were analysed using Δj and Rct values, respectively. The SWV approach was  used to generate calibration curves that plot rN protein concentration against  Δj (mA·cm⁻2). The Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP electrode showed a linear regression  slope of 7.75 mA·cm⁻2·nM⁻1 (R2 = 0.97), while the Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP  electrode had a slope of 0.57 mA·cm⁻2·nM⁻1 (R2 = 0.97). The slope of Rct  (Ω·cm2) vs rN protein concentration for the Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP electrode was  37.52 Ω·cm2·nM⁻1 (R2 = 0.99), while for the Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP electrode it  was 4.77 Ω·cm2·nM⁻1 (R2 = 0.96). The sensitivity derived from the calibration  curves of the MIP-modified Au(SPE)/SAM electrode for rN detection was  approximately 13.5 times higher for Δj measurements and 8 times higher for  Rct measurements compared to the NIP-modified Au(SPE)/SAM electrode,  highlighting the superior performance of the MIP-modified electrodes. The  LOD and LOQ for the developed immunosensor were calculated using EIS  method (Equations 2 and 3).     Figure 21. Calibration curves for Δj obtained from SWV (A) and Rct obtained  from EIS (B), respectively, vs. rN concentration. Error bars are expressed as  the standard deviation of the sample.  For the SWV-based method, the LOD and LOQ were not calculated, as  the data presented in Figure 21 suggest that the EIS-based method provided  more reliable results. For the EIS-based method, the LOD and LOQ were  determined to be 0.2 nM and 0.66 nM, respectively. These findings highlight  the high sensitivity and promising potential of the MIP-modified

Au(SPE)/SAM electrodes in designing biosensors for rN protein detection.  The formation of a SAM underlayer plays a crucial role in this design by  providing a well-organised, stable, and functional surface that enhances the  electrode's sensitivity. The SAM underlayer facilitates the effective formation  of the MIP layer, ensuring a uniform and controlled distribution of specific  binding sites. This not only improves the selective recognition of the rN  protein but also minimises nonspecific interactions, thereby contributing to  the overall performance and reliability of the biosensor.  3.3.4. Specificity test   The investigation of nonspecific binding on Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP  involved comparing the electrochemical signal responses, as shown in  Figure 22. These comparisons were based on the initial electrochemical signal  responses obtained after immersing the electrodes in a 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4,  solution containing a redox probe and either 35 nM rS or 35 nM BSA protein.  The analysis showed that for Δj obtained from SWV, the relative response  (RR) percentages were 13.0 ± 2.5% for BSA and 6.54 ± 0.86% for rS protein.  Similarly, for Rct obtained from the EIS method, the RR percentages were  15.1 ± 2.32% for BSA and 0.93 ± 0.09% for rS protein. Overall, the sensor  shows good specificity for rN protein.

3.4. The determination of the VEGF protein using a self-assembling  aptamer-based electrochemical sensor   As mentioned in previous sections, this research employed a thin Ppy  underlayer before developing the polymer-supported aptamer sensing layer.  This essential step enhanced the adhesion of the sensing layer and reduced  direct interaction between the target analyte and the electrode surface, thereby  improving the performance of the Ppy/anti-VEGF sensing layer. Moreover,  the thin Ppy-based underlayer played a crucial role in minimising direct  interaction between the anti-VEGF and the electrode surface during the  formation of the sensing layer, facilitating the effective creation of the  Ppy/anti-VEGF-based sensing layer.   3.4.1. The electrodeposition of polypyrrole-based VEGF aptamer  Using a series of potential pulses, polymer-based layers were  electrochemically deposited on the surface of SPCE. The profile of the  potential pulses during the application of the polypyrrole-based layer to SPCE  is illustrated in Figure 23 A. Following the experimental procedures outlined  in the experimental section, a polypyrrole-based VEGF aptamer (Ppy/anti- VEGF) layer was formed on SPCEs through a two-step process (Figure 23 B,  C). A Ppy underlayer was electrochemically deposited in the initial step using  a solution containing 0.1 M pyrrole in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4. This was achieved  by applying a series of 5 potential pulses (+0.95 V for 1 second followed by  0 V for 30 seconds). The resulting thin Ppy underlayer was designed to  enhance the adhesion and performance of the sensing layer while reducing  direct interactions between the electrode and the target analyte. Specifically,  it minimised the direct interaction of VEGF aptamer with the electrode  surface, facilitating more effective Ppy/anti-VEGF layer formation.  In the subsequent step, the anti-VEGF was introduced to the same  polymerisation solution, and the sequence of 5 potential pulses was repeated.  This approach allowed the anti-VEGF to be embedded within the Ppy matrix,  enhancing the stability and support of the aptamer while also shielding the  electrode surface. This strategy is analogous to methods used in MIPs and  SAM systems. Overall, this two-step process is essential for optimising the  adhesion and functional performance of the sensing layer.

3.4.2. Electrochemical characterisation of polypyrrole-based aptamer layer  and VEGF detection  Duration selection in the PAD method is essential for obtaining precise  and sensitive electrochemical measurements. In this study, 10 pulses of 0 V  and 10 pulses of +0.6 V, each lasting 2 seconds, were employed (Figure 24 A),  as previously used in my studies. The selection of +0.6 V for detection was  guided by its effectiveness in triggering the desired electrochemical reactions  and yielding an optimal signal response. Additionally, it has been reported that  at +0.65 V vs Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl), unsubstituted Ppy starts to overoxidise [122].     Figure 23. Electrochemical deposition of Ppy layers: (A) on SPCE electrodes,  showing the profile of the current registered during the formation of the Ppy layer from polymerisation solution without anti-VEGF. Ppy underlayers on  SPCE electrodes (B) and of the Ppy layers with anti-VEGF entrapped as a  sensing element of the system (C). Inset (D-F): Potential pulse sequence for  the signal analysis. Measurements were performed in 10 mM PBS solution,  pH 7.4.  During the evaluation of current variations induced by potential pulses,  careful analysis was conducted to monitor the current drop at specific points  or intervals within the pulses of +0.6 V and 0 V. These key intervals included  0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, 0.8 s, and 2.0 s (Figure 24 B). Examining current  changes at precise moments within the potential pulses enables the  characterisation of distinct electrochemical processes, allowing for the  identification of different redox reactions or species that exhibit varying  kinetics or affinities for the electrode surface. This method provides a detailed  understanding of the electrochemical system.  Figure 24 A shows a graphical representation of the PAD method, with  time on the x-axis and current on the y-axis. Figure 24 B shows the two pulses  applied to the electrode, one at +0.6 V and the other at 0 V. Specific time  points, marked on the x-axis at the aforementioned time points, indicate the  extracted current values for both potentials. These values were labelled as ΔI  0.1 s for 0.6 V and 0 V. Similarly, data points were collected at intervals of  0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, and 0.8 s, labelled as ΔI 0.1 s, ΔI 0.2 s, ΔI 0.4 s,  ΔI 0.6 s, and ΔI 0.8 s, respectively. These time points correspond to different  moments within the pulse duration and were used for further analysis, as  detailed in the following discussion (Figure 25).    Figure 24.

3.4.3. The evaluation of analytical parameters. Adapted Langmuir isotherm  Figure 24 illustrates the current response observed during various  intervals, emphasising the significance of pulse length in the PAD method. To  measure VEGF across concentrations ranging from 0 to 24 nM, potential pulse  values of +0.6 V and 0 V were applied. Different pulse durations were tested,  including 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s and 0.8 s. Calibration curves were plotted  (Figure 25) using normalised responses (NR ΔIat Xs) from PAD measurements.  These measurements were conducted after incubating Ppy/anti-VEGF and  Ppy electrodes in a 10 mM PBS solution, pH 7.4, with VEGF at various  concentrations. The incubation lasted 15 minutes at room temperature. After  incubation, the electrodes were rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4, between different  VEGF concentrations. To normalise the ΔI signals, the response at 0 nM  VEGF was set to zero (Equation 7).

Therefore, our  investigation relies significantly on mathematical analysis, specifically the  Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. This approach involves fitting  experimental data to the Langmuir isotherm to extract model parameters.  In a study by Gonzato et al. [123], cilostazol-extracted MIPs embedded  in a polymer film were used to measure analyte binding parameters. They  employed Freundlich, Langmuir, and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms to  analyse their data. The Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm provided the best fit,  suggesting the presence of highly homogeneous and relatively homogeneous  binding sites within the polymer matrix. Similarly, Çalık, Balcı, and  Özdamar [124] performed equilibrium binding analyses for recombinant  human growth hormone (rhGH) in both liquid-phase and immobilized- aptamer phases using the Langmuir-type adsorption isotherm (Equation 8).  Building on this prior research, the Langmuir isotherm model was adapted for  the results illustrated in Figure 25.  ∆𝐼𝐼= ∆𝐼𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚× [𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉] 𝐾𝐾× [𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉]  (8)  where ΔImax is the maximal normalised value of current density, K – is the  adapted Langmuir constant, and [VEGF] – is the concentration of VEGF. K,  ΔImax, and R2 values can be found in Table 4. Figure 25. Calibration curves (NR ∆I(at Xs) vs. VEGF protein concentration)  obtained using modified electrodes of Ppy and Ppy/anti-VEGF for specific  moments in the potential pulse at 0.1 s (A), 0.2 s (B), 0.4 s (C), 0.6 s (D),  0.8 s (E).

These moments include 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, and  0.8 s (Figure 25 A-E), along with their corresponding standard deviation  errors. The high R2 values, close to 1, across these different time points,  indicate a good fit of the experimental data to the adapted Langmuir model.  This suggests that the Langmuir model is well-suited for describing the  adsorption behaviour of VEGF on the sensing surface.  Figure 25 F shows how K varies with the specific moments in the  potential pulse for both Ppy/anti-VEGF and Ppy-modified electrodes.  Notably, K values tend to increase with longer specific moments, indicating a  positive correlation between the duration of the interaction and the affinity of  VEGF for the sensing material. This trend suggests that prolonged exposure  to VEGF enhances binding interactions, resulting in a higher equilibrium  constant. Longer specific moments likely facilitate greater adsorption of  VEGF molecules onto the surface, thereby improving the sensitivity and  specificity of the sensor.  The observed increase in K values from 1.25 ± 0.09 nM to 2.47 ± 0.49 nM  with longer specific moments underscores the importance of optimising  experimental conditions to achieve desired sensitivity and accuracy in VEGF  detection. Optimising the duration of these specific intervals could improve  VEGF binding while ensuring that the dynamic range and reliability of the  sensor are maintained. Additionally, careful calibration and testing during  these intervals may further enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of the sensor.  It is also worth noting that the K values for the Ppy layer remain relatively  consistent, indicating stable performance across different conditions.

Consequently, ΔImax values for the Ppy/anti-VEGF layer are consistently  lower than those for the Ppy layer with longer specific moments in the  potential pulse. This suggests that fine-tuning the pulse duration could be a  crucial factor in balancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, as longer  intervals may allow for more controlled interactions but at the expense of peak  signal intensity.  3.4.4. Adaptation of integrated Cottrell equation  The integrated Cottrell equation (Anson plot) was employed to analyse  the results further and discuss them. The relation of the cumulative charge  passed and time in Ppy-based electrochemical sensors obeys the integrated  Cottrell equation (Equations 9-11):  𝑄𝑄= 𝑄𝑄𝑓𝑓+ 𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑.𝑙𝑙. + 𝑄𝑄𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎.

Anson et al. [125] highlighted the effectiveness of the double potential  step chronocoulometric technique for accurately quantifying adsorbed  reactants. This approach provides valuable insights into electrochemical  processes without requiring complex models. In the context of the integrated  Cottrell equation, the total charge accumulation consists of three components:  Faradaic charges (Qf) resulting from redox activity, charges from the charging  and discharging of the electrode-electrolyte double-layer capacitance (Qd.l.),  and changes in charge due to adsorbed species (Qads.). A linear relationship is  observed when plotting the total charge (Q) against the square root of time  (t1/2). The plot of Q versus t½ shows a linear correlation where the slope  represents k and the intercept represents Qads. + Qd.l.. The study noted that  maximum adsorption generally occurs at intermediate concentrations of  specific compounds, and variations in adsorption patterns indicate bonding  interactions between the reactants and the electrode surface. A previous  study [126] examined how electrode modifications affect the adsorption  behaviour of analytes and reaction products. Unlike earlier studies using plain electrodes, this study employed Pt electrodes modified with the conducting  polymer Ppy, which were further imprinted or non-imprinted with  glycoprotein. This modification added extra layers and functionalities to the  electrode surface, thereby altering the electrochemical behaviour of the  system. The Ppy layer could participate in charging and discharging processes  during electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions by varying the  potential.  In the study presented in this dissertation, a polymer-supported aptamer  layer on the electrode was used. While this complexity adds challenges to  analysing amperograms, it is still possible to describe them using the  framework proposed by Anson.    Figure 26. The Anson plots (Q vs. t½) derived from the amperometric  response registered during the last (10th) potential pulse of the applied  potential pulse sequence (0.6 V and 0 V) for Ppy/anti-VEGF modified  electrode (A) and Ppy modified electrode (B). Slope (C) and intercept (D)  values represent the linear regression equation y = ax + b (from) vs. the  concentration of VEGF protein (nM).   Figure 26 provides a detailed analysis of the Anson plots for the  amperogram data shown in Figure 24. Figure 26 A presents the results for  Ppy/anti-VEGF, while Figure 26 B shows the results for Ppy. Linear  regression was employed to fit the relationship between the total charge (Q) and the square root of time (t1/2). The parameters of the corresponding  equations are listed in Table 5, which also shows the R2 values indicating a  strong linear correlation in the Q vs. t1/2 plots.  Table 5.

These plots reveal differences  in slope and intercept values between Ppy/anti-VEGF and Ppy-modified  electrodes under identical experimental conditions. Specifically, Figure 26 C  shows a notable decrease in the slope of the Anson equation, calculated using  equation 9, with increasing VEGF concentrations. The slope is influenced by  factors including the number of electrons (n) transferred during the  electrochemical reaction, the electrochemically active area (A), the material  concentration (C), and the diffusion coefficient (D). These results suggest that  the observed decrease in the slope with higher VEGF concentrations reflects  a reduction in the electrochemically active area, assuming that electrons and  D remain constant across all VEGF concentrations due to consistent solution  properties (e.g., density and viscosity). Notably, this effect is more  pronounced for the Ppy/anti-VEGF-modified electrode compared to the Ppy- modified electrode.  In  chronocoulometric  experiments,  the  charge  accumulates  proportionally with t1/2 as additional reactants diffuse to the electrode surface.  When some of the reactant adsorbs onto the electrode/electrolyte interface at  0 V, it will be reduced almost immediately upon switching to +0.6 V, resulting  in an additional charge burst. However, after this initial response, the  chronocoulometric behaviour is generally unaffected by the adsorbed reactant.  Consequently, the plots of Q vs. t1/2 will have intercepts exceeding Q by an  amount equivalent to Qdl, with the slope remaining unchanged by the presence  of the adsorbed reactant. The values of Qads provide direct measures of the

quantity of adsorbed reactant according to Faraday's Law (Equation 10),  where Γ represents the quantity of adsorbed reactant in moles. Figure 26 D  shows intercept values corresponding to VEGF protein concentration (nM),  where the intercept represents Qads + Qdl. To determine Qads from the intercept  in a chronocoulometric plot of Q vs. t1/2, it is essential to measure or estimate  Qdl . This measurement is straightforward if the adsorption of the reactant does  not significantly alter the interfacial capacitance, allowing the Qdl value from  a blank experiment (0 nM VEGF) to be applied to measurements in the  presence of the adsorbing analyte [127].  3.4.5. The determination of the limit of detection  PAD-based electrochemical measurements were performed to determine  the LOD. Intercept values, representing Qads + Qdl, were obtained from  Table 5. To evaluate Qads, blank experiments were conducted with 0 nM of  VEGF for both Ppy and Ppy/anti-VEGF electrodes, serving as the baseline  analytical signals. Figure 27 presents the linear calibration of VEGF protein  concentration plotted against ΔQ (mC). The slope for VEGF concentration  (nM) measured with the Ppy electrode was 0.001 mC/nM with an R2 value of  0.96, whereas the slope for VEGF on the Ppy/anti-VEGF modified electrode  was 0.1 mC/nM with an R2 value of 0.99. The LOD was calculated using  Equation 2. It was evaluated that the LOD for the modified electrode  Ppy/anti‑VEGF was 0.21 nM.    Figure 27.

CONCLUSIONS  1.  Through the application of the pulsed amperometric deposition  technique, a polypyrrole-based underlayer was developed and integrated  into the design of a molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensor suitable  for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. During the  preparation process, trypsin was used to efficiently extract and remove  the imprinted bacterial templates. The resulting sensor achieved a LOD  of 70 CFU/mL and a LOQ of 210 CFU/mL.  2.  The electrochemical properties of various SAM-modified gold electrodes  were determined. The formation of an 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid self- assembled monolayer on the Au(s) electrode created an insulating layer  that significantly increased charge transfer resistance. In contrast, the  Au(MS) electrode modified with a self-assembled monolayer mixture  (composed of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol and 11-mercaptoundecanoic  acid) exhibited a lower charge transfer resistance, making it suitable for  the development of a label-free immunosensor used to detect antibodies  against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, achieving a LOD of 2.78 nM and  a LOQ of 9.17 nM.   3.  Sensor for the determination of SARS‑CoV‑2 nucleocapsid protein was  designed by the formation of self-assembled monolayer under-layer on a  screen-printed electrode modified by gold nanostructures, followed by  deposition of molecularly imprinted polypyrrole layer. The selectivity  towards the target protein was confirmed by electrochemical analysis  methods. An increase in charge transfer resistance was observed with  increasing concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The  sensor exhibited a LOD and LOQ of 0.2 nM and 0.66 nM, respectively,  using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.  4.  A self-assembling DNA aptamer was incorporated into a conducting  polypyrrole matrix, supported by a polypyrrole underlayer, on a screen- printed carbon electrode. The modified electrode was used for the  detection of VEGF protein, achieving a LOD of 0.21 nM. The use of the  pulsed amperometric technique allowed to simplify the detection process  by eliminating the application of redox mediators.

FUTURE OUTLOOK  This dissertation opens several pathways for advancing electrochemical  sensor technologies. An immediate step involves transitioning from controlled  laboratory conditions to testing in more realistic settings, beginning with  spiked or artificially produced blood samples. Following successful  validation, the next stage would involve testing with actual clinical or  environmental samples to assess the sensors' robustness, reproducibility, and  practical utility. Simultaneously, the development of multiplexed sensors  capable of simultaneously detecting multiple analytes should be prioritised to  enhance diagnostic capabilities for complex systems. Additionally, integrating  these sensors into portable, real-time platforms would revolutionise point-of- care diagnostics, particularly in resource-limited settings. Expanding the  application of molecularly imprinted polymers and aptamer-embedded  systems will further enable the detection of rare disease biomarkers and  foodborne pathogens. By addressing these future directions sequentially,  researchers can build on the advancements presented in this work to create  versatile, high-performance sensors that meet the evolving demands of  modern analytical technologies.

Pastoviai didėja šių analizinių technologijų sudėtingumas  ir taikymo mastai. Todėl, siekiant pagerinti jutiklių  jautrumą, stabilumą ir  selektyvumą tenka kurti naujas šiose analizinėse sistemose taikomas  medžiagas ir novatoriškus analizės metodus. Tarp įvairių analizinėse  sistemose taikomų medžiagų yra ir unikaliomis elektrocheminėmis savybėmis  pasižymintys elektrai laidūs polimerai bei jų kompozitai, kurie yra dažnai  naudojami kaip svarbūs naujos kartos jutiklių komponentai. Sukurti jutiklius,  kurie atitiktų vis griežtesnius šiuolaikinių taikomųjų programų reikalavimus,  yra sudėtinga užduotis, apimanti ne tik tinkamų medžiagų pasirinkimą, bet ir  jų integravimą į sudėtingas sistemas, užtikrinančias didesnį analizės našumą.  Siekiant šių tikslų, derinant elektrai laidžius polimerus su kitomis funkcinėmis medžiagomis tokiomis kaip savitvarkiai monosluoksniai (SAM) arba DNR- aptamerai, galima sukurti atrankesnes kompozitines struktūras.  Elektrocheminiai metodai, tokie kaip elektrocheminė impedanso  spektroskopija (EIS), kvadratinės bangos voltamperometrija (KBV) ir  impulsinė amperometrija (PAD), tapo esminėmis priemonėmis tobulinant  jutiklių technologijas. EIS yra universalus metodas, skirtas analizuoti jutiklio  paviršiaus elektrines savybes. Matuojant sistemos varžą, sistemą žadinant  įvairių dažnių kintama elektros srovę, taikant EIS metodą galima gauti išsamią  informaciją apie elektrodo paviršiaus pokyčius, tokius kaip SAM arba  molekuliniu būdu įspaustų polimerų (MIP) susiformavimą. Šis metodas ypač  naudingas vertinant įvairių elektrodo modifikacijų stabilumą ir nustatant  jutiklio paviršiaus pokyčius po sąveikos su analitėmis. KBV yra pažangus  metodas, pasižymintis dideliu jautrumu ir skiriamąja geba, todėl puikiai tinka  mažoms nustatomų medžiagų koncentracijoms aptikti. PAD yra dažnai  naudojamas elektrocheminės polimerizacijos metu ant jutiklio paviršiaus  susidariusių polimerų sluoksnių storiui įvertinti. Keičiant elektrodui  užduodamų impulsų potencialus bei trukmę, galima suformuoti įvairios  struktūros ir įvairaus storio polimerų sluoksnius.. Be to, PAD taip pat gali būti  naudojamas analizinio signalo įvertinimui.  Visi minėti elektrocheminiai metodai (EIS, KBV ir PAD) įgalina įvairiais  aspektais įvertinti elektrodo paviršiaus modifikavimo efektyvumą, bei atlikti  tiek kokybinį, tiek kiekybinį įvairių analičių nustatymą. Šiuos metodus taikant  jutikliuose, kuriuose selektyvaus analitės atpažinimo funkciją atlieka  struktūros grįstos elektrai laidžių polimerų panaudojimu, galima ženkliai  padidinti jų jautrį ir selektyvumą.  Darbo tikslas:  Pritaikyti pažangias laidžiųjų polimerų kompozitų gamybos technologijas  molekuliniu būdu įspaustų jutiklių ir imuninių jutiklių kūrimui.   Darbo uždaviniai:  1.  Spausdinto montažo anglies elektrodą, padengti polipirolo sluoksniu  modifikuotu bakterijų Listeria monocytogenes paviršinių struktūrų  įspaudais, ir pritaikyti bakterijų Listeria monocytogenes aptikimui.  2.  Skirtingais savitvarkiais monosluoksniais modifikuotus aukso elektrodus  pritaikyti imuninio jutiklio, skirto antikūnams prieš SARS-CoV-2  spyglio baltymą aptikti, kūrimui.  3.  Sukurti jutiklį, skirtą SARS-CoV-2 nukleokapsidės baltymui aptikti,  suformuojant  kompopzitinę  struktūrą  sudarytą  iš  savitvarkio monosluoksnio pasluoksnio ir SARS-CoV-2 nukleokapsidės baltymo  molekulių įspaudais modifikuoto polipirolo sluoksnio.   4.  Sukurti jutiklį, skirtą kraujagyslių endotelio augimo faktoriui (angl.  vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF) aptikti, panaudojant  aptamerus, įterptus į elektrai laidaus polipirolo matricą.   Mokslinis naujumas  Daugelyje disertacijoje aprašytų tyrimų yra taikomas elektrai laidus  polimeras – polipirolas. Šis elektrai laidus polimeras pasižymi geru biologiniu  suderinamumu. Disertacijoje aptariamos šio polimero pritaikymo jutikliuose  galimybės, panaudojant kelis skirtingus kompozitinių struktūrų formavimo  metodus:(1) polipirolo sluoksnyje suformuojant molekulių įspaudus, (2)  formuojant molekuliniu būdu įspaustus polipirolo sluoksnius ant savitvarkių  monosluoksnių (SAM) pasluoksnių, (3) į Ppy sluoksnį įterpiant DNR- aptamerus.  Pirmuose tyrimo etapuose buvo formuojami MIP, kurie buvo suformuoti  polimerizuojant polipirolo sluoksnį su įterptomis  ląstelėmis arba SARS-CoV- 2 viruso baltymų molekulėmis. Po įterptos ląstelės arba baltymo molekulės  pašalinimo polimero matricoje susidaro įspaustai struktūrai komplementarios  ertmės, įgalinančios selektyviai ir jautriai aptikti įspaustąją struktūrą.  Disertacijoje aprašytuose tyrimuose buvo taikomas  papildomas SAM  pasluoksnio formavimas, kuris buvo atliekamas prieš MIP sluoksnio  formavimą. Tai įgalina orientuoti analitės molekulę, suformuoti plonesnį  polipirolo sluoksnį ant elektrodo, pagerinti analitės difuziją ir sąveiką su MIP.  Todėl taikant SAM pasluoksnį galima pagerinti jutiklio jautrumą ir  selektyvumą. Dar viena tyrimu kryptis nagrinėjama šioje disertacijoje buvo  skirta kompozitų sudarytų iš DNR-aptamerų ir Ppy taikymui jutikliuose.  Aptamero įterpimas į polimero matricą, įgalina sukurti struktūrą tinkamą  aptamerui komplementarios analitės nustatymui.  Šioje disertacijoje aprašyti tyrimo metodai buvo pritaikyti jutikliuose,  kuriuose pritaikyti MIP sluoksniai. Viena iš tirtų tyrimams pasirinktų analičių  yra Listeria monocytogenes bakterijos, kurios sukelia maistu plintančias ligas  ir yra viena pagrindinių su šių ligų komplikacijomis susijusių mirčių  priežasčių. Šiai analitei aptikti buvo kuriamas jutiklis, naudojant molekulių  įspaudų technologiją. Polimero matricoje buvo suformuotos specifinės vietos,  komplementarios bakterijos išorinėms struktūroms, taip užtikrinant greitą ir  tikslų Listeria monocytogenes bakterijų aptikimą. Kita tirtų analičių buvo  SARS-CoV-2 viruso nukleokapsidės baltymas. Šis baltymas buvo įterptas į  Ppy sluoksnį, suformuotą ant SAM pasluoksnio. Pašalinus baltymą iš Ppy  struktūros, susidarė ertmės, kurios yra komplementarios SARS-CoV-2 viruso nukleokapsidės baltymui, užtikrinant tikslų jo atpažinimą. Trečioji analitė  buvo VEGF, kuris yra svarbus nustatant navikų augimą, metastazes ir  kraujagyslių susidarymo procesus. VEGF aptikimui buvo sukurtas jutiklis, iš  trijų atskirų DNR fragmentų suformuotą DNR-aptamerą, įterpiant į polipirolo  sluoksnį, suformuotą ant spausdinto montažo būdu pagaminto grafito  elektrodo modifikuoto papildomai suformuotu Ppy pasluoksniu.   Disertacijoje pateikiami tyrimai skirti jutiklių technologijų tobulinimui ir  skatina jutiklių technologijų pažangą.  Ginamieji teiginiai:   1.  Listeria monocytogenes bakterijų išorinių struktūrų įspaudais  modifikuotas polipirolo sluoksnis gali būti suformuotas ant spausdinto  montažo būdu pagaminto grafito elektrodo, panaudojant elektrinio  potencialo impulsus. Taip modifikuotas elektrodas buvo tinkamas  bakterijų Listeria monocytogenes aptikimui.  2.  Mišriu savitvarkiu monosluoksniu modifikuotas aukso elektrodas gali  būti pritaikytas imuninio jutiklio, skirto antikūnų prieš SARS-CoV-2  spyglio baltymą aptikimui netaikant elektrocheminių žymenų, kūrimui.  3.  Kompozitas, sudarytas iš savitvarkio monosluoksnio pasluoksnio ir  molekulių įspaudais modifikuoto polipirolo sluoksnio, gali būti  panaudotas jutiklio kūrimui, skirto SARS-CoV-2 nukleokapsidės  baltymui aptikti.  4.  Elektrai laidaus polipirolo matrica modifikuota DNR aptamerais gali  būti panaudota kuriant jutiklį, skirtą kraujagyslių endotelio augimo  faktoriaus aptikimui. LITERATŪROS APŽVALGA  Elektrai laidūs polimerai  Elektrai laidžių polimerų taikymo sritys sparčiai plėtėsi, dėl unikalių jų  puslaidininkinių savybių. Elektrai laidžių polimerų tyrimai prasidėjo po to, kai  1977 m. Shirakawa ir kt. [2] pastebėjo šių medžiagų elektrinį laidumą. Šie  elektrai laidūs polimerai yra π-π konjuguoti, o tai leidžia elektronų  delokalizaciją, kuri suteikia jiems elektrinį laidumą, kai jie yra legiruojami  tinkamomis medžiagomis. Šios medžiagos įveda arba pašalina elektronus į π- π konjuguotą sistemą, todėl π-elektronai gali laisvai judėti polimero  grandinėje, taip pagerinanant elektrinį laidumą. Elektrai laidūs polimerai yra  itin svarbūs dėl savo unikalių elektrinių, magnetinių ir optinių savybių.  Dažniausiai praktiniams tikslams taikomi elektrai laidūs polimerai yra  polianilinas, polipirolas ir politiofenas.  Polipirolo savybės ir sintezės metodai  Polipirolas (angl. polypyrrole, toliau – Ppy) yra laidus polimeras,  pasižymintis lengva sinteze, stabilumu ir daug žadančiomis elektrinėmis  savybėmis. Iš pradžių Ppy buvo gaunamas naudojant cheminę sintezę [8],  tačiau dabar jis taip pat gali būti susintetinamas elektrocheminiu būdu,  pasitelkiant oksidacinės polimerizacijos metodą. Elektrocheminė sintezė,  kurios metu monomeras tiesiogiai oksiduojamas prie anodo, turi keletą  privalumų: procesas yra paprastesnis, leidžia pasiekti didesnį galutinio  produkto grynumą ir tiksliau kontroliuoti polimerizacijos sąlygas. Šiai sintezei  dažniausiai yra naudojami galvanostatinis (pastovios srovės) arba  potenciostatinis (nuolatinio potencialo) metodai.  Galvanostatinis metodas palaiko pastovų srovės stiprį, todėl galima  tiksliai kontroliuoti susidarančio polimero sluoksnio storį. Tačiau, didėjant  polimero sluoksniui, jo elektrinė varža taip pat didėja, dėl ko gali atsirasti  nepageidaujamų šalutinių reakcijų [11, 12, 13, 14]. Potenciostatinis metodas  palaiko pastovų elektrinį potencialą (įtampą) per visą sintezės procesą. Tai  reiškia, kad reakcija vyksta esant nustatytam įtampos lygiui, o ne pastoviai  srovei, kaip naudojant galvanostatinį metodą. Šis metodas leidžia tiksliau  kontroliuoti  polimerinio  sluoksnio  augimą,  todėl  galima  išvengti  nepageidaujamų šalutinių reakcijų, kurios gali atsirasti, jei sintezės sąlygos  yra pernelyg agresyvios. Pastovaus potencialo palaikymas taip pat apsaugo  nuo per didelės monomerų oksidacijos, užtikrindamas geresnę polimero  sluoksnio kokybę [15, 16]. Be to, modifikuota impulsų potenciostatinė  technika, kuri keičia anodinius ir katodinius impulsus, dar labiau pagerina  polimero sluoksnio kokybę. Ši technika periodiškai keičia srovės kryptį, dėl ko keičiasi elektrodo paviršiaus įkrova. Dėl to monomerai gali lengviau  difunduoti link elektrodo paviršiaus, nuolat pasipildydami šalia jo. Tai padeda  išlaikyti tolygų polimerizacijos procesą, sumažina šalutinių reakcijų tikimybę  ir užtikrina vienodesnį bei kokybiškesnį polimero sluoksnį [17, 18].  Molekuliniu būdu įspaustų polimerų (MIP) kūrimas ir taikymas  Molekulinių įspaudų technologija remiasi analitės (šablono) ir funkcinio  monomero sąveika. Polimerizacijos metu, esant dideliam monomero kiekiui,  susidaro trimatis polimero tinklelis su įterpta analite. Po polimerizacijos  analitės šablonas yra pašalinamas iš polimero struktūros ir jo vietoje lieka  analitei specifinės ertmės, kurios atitinka šablono formą, dydį ir cheminį  funkcionalumą. Šios ertmės yra skirtos tikslinei analitei nustatyti. Molekulinio  atpažinimo  procesą  lemia  komplementarios  sąveikos,  tokios  kaip  vandeniliniai ryšiai, dipolio-dipolio sąveikos ir joninės sąveikos tarp šablono  molekulės ir polimero matricos funkcinių grupių. Dėl šių sąveikų polimeras  tampa selektyvus ir specifiškai atpažįsta nustatomą molekulės šabloną [19].  Pagrindinis molekulinių įspaudų polimerų privalumas yra didelis jų  selektyvumas ir stiprus giminingumas įspaustai molekulei. Vis dėlto, vienas  didžiausių iššūkių, su kuriuo susiduria MIP tyrėjai, yra efektyvus šablono  sukūrimas, leidžiantis tiksliai atpažinti norimą analitę. Nepaisant šio iššūkio,  MIP turi didelį potencialą įvairiose biotechnologijų ir aplinkosaugos srityse  [21, 22]. MIP dažnai naudojami afininėse jutiklių sistemose, kai polimero  matrica leidžia selektyviai atpažinti konkrečias molekules, baltymus, virusus,  bakterijas ar cheminius junginius. Tokie jutikliai selektyviai atpažįsta tikslines  analites ir generuoja išmatuojamus signalus [20]. Molekuliniu būdu įspausti  polimerai yra perspektyvi alternatyva tradiciniams jutikliams, kurie naudoja  antikūnus ar receptorius, nes MIP dažnai pasižymi geresniu stabilumu ir  patikimumu nei tradicinės sistemos [23, 24].  Norint efektyviai valdyti analičių ir jutiklių paviršių sąveiką, svarbu  taikyti įvairius būdus, kurie galėtų padidinti specifiškumą. Vienas iš  sprendimų galėtų būti polimerų pasluoksnio naudojimas, kuris sumažintų  nepageidaujamą adsorbciją. Kitas panaudojimo būdas galėtų būti savitvarkių  monosluoksnių (SAM) pasluoksnių integravimas, siekiant sumažinti  nespecifinė sąveika tarp analitės ir elektrodo paviršiaus. Be to, į polimero  matricą galima įterpti DNR aptamerus, kurie būtų panaudoti kaip selektyvūs  atpažinimo elementai. Šių metodų taikymas suteikia galimybę plėsti MIP  naudojimą biologiniuose jutikliuose. Polimerinio pasluoksnio formavimas  Šis metodas apima plono polipirolo pasluoksnio formavimą, kuris  sumažina sąveiką tarp analitės ir elektrodo paviršiaus. Ant šio pasluoksnio  galima suformuoti MIP sluoksnį, leidžiantį jutikliui tiksliai atpažinti norimą  analitę. Pavyzdžiui, Ktari ir kt. aprašė, kad flumekvinas gali būti aptinkamas  naudojant paviršinių akustinių bangų (angl. surface acoustic waves – SAW)  signalų perdavimo sistemą [32]. Tyrimuose buvo nurodyta, kad flumekvino  molekulės gali sąveikauti su aukso paviršiumi, sutrikdydamos jo  elektrocheminį aktyvumą, kas gali turėti neigiamos įtakos jutiklių veikimui.  Mano tyrime buvo pasirinktas polipirolo pasluoksnio formavimas, siekiant  sumažinti šiuos trukdžius. Šis metodas, neleidžia analitėms adsorbuotis ant  elektrodo paviršiaus, taip sumažindamas galimus trukdžius ir užtikrindamas  patikimesnius matavimo rezultatus. Taigi, šiame darbe buvo taikyta panaši  technika, kur Ppy pasluoksnio suformavimas buvo itin svarbus MIP sluoksnio  formavimui ir jutiklio patikimumo gerinimui.  Savitvarkių monosluoksnių struktūra, formavimosi procesai ir taikymas  jutiklių paviršių modifikavimui  Kita strategija apima SAM naudojimą jutiklių kūrimui. Tai patogus  būdas keisti metalų, metalų oksidų ir puslaidininkių paviršiaus savybes. SAM  – tai organiniai sluoksniai, susidarantys absorbuojant molekules iš tirpalo arba  dujų fazės ant kietų paviršių. Adsorbuotos molekulės dažnai išsidėsto į  kristalines arba pusiau kristalines struktūras [33].  Savitvarkius monosluoksnius sudarančios molekulės turi tris pagrindines  dalis: galinę grupę, pradinę grupę ir pagrindinę grandinę. Pagrindinė grandinė  jungia dvi grupes ir padeda sukurti tvarkingą struktūrą. SAM formavimosi  metu molekulės su galine grupe (angl. head group), pasižyminčia stipriu  afinitetu substratui, jungiasi prie paviršiaus ir išstumia anksčiau adsorbuotas  organines medžiagas. Skirtingos galinės grupės selektyviai jungiasi su  metalais, metalų oksidais ir puslaidininkiais, sudarydamos stiprius cheminius  ryšius ant paviršiaus [34]. Dažniausias metodas – alkanotiolių adsorbcija iš  etanolio tirpalo ant polikristalinio aukso paviršiaus. Kai pradinė grupė (angl.  terminal group) atsiranda SAM paviršiuje, ji lemia savitvarkio monosluoksnio  fizines ir chemines savybes, tokias kaip hidrofilinės ar hidrofobinės savybės.  Alkanotiolatų ir aukso kompleksai sudaro mažus kristalinius monosluoksnio  regionus, kurie toliau auga, adsorbuojantis papildomoms tiolio molekulėms.  Molekulių persitvarkymas sustiprina van der Waals sąveiką tarp jų, todėl  susidaro tankus ir tvarkingas monosluoksnis [38].   SAM formavimas pagrįstas stipria disulfidų, sulfidų ir tiolių adsorbcija  ant aukso paviršiaus, kurią stabilizuoja van der Waals jėgos [39]. Voltametriniai tyrimai parodė, kad adsorbcijos metu tiolio grupės  deprotonuojasi [40]. Naudojant ω-funkcionalizuotus tiolius, prie SAM galima  stipriai prijungti įvairias chemines grupes, leidžiančias sukurti naujas  paviršiaus savybes, reikalingas biomolekulių surišimui [42, 43]. Mišrūs SAM,  sudaryti iš dviejų skirtingų tiolių, gali sumažinti baltymų denatūraciją ir  pagerinti imobilizuotų baltymų bioaktyvumą [44–46]. Tokie SAM paprastai  turi vieną tiolatą su funkcine grupe ir kitą – inertišką, taip sumažindami sterinę  kliūtį ir nespecifines sąveikas [45]. Tiolių funkcinių grupių pobūdis lemia jų  sąveiką su biomolekulėmis. Mažos pradinės grupės, tokios kaip NH2 ar OH,  padeda išlaikyti glaudžią ir tvarkingą monosluoksnio struktūrą, o didesnės,  pavyzdžiui, COOH, sumažina sluoksnio tankumą ir tvarką [47]. Mišriuose  monosluoksniuose ω-pakeisti tioliai ir trumpesni alkanotioliai adsorbuojasi  proporcingai jų kiekiui tirpale, o tai leidžia sumažinti sterinę kliūtį ir pagerinti  paviršiaus savybes [50, 51]. SAM mišinys, sudarytas iš 6-merkapto-1- heksanolio (6-MCOH) ir 11-merkaptoundekano rūgštis (11-MUA), užtikrina  tikslų paviršiaus modifikavimą, palengvina biomolekulių imobilizavimą ir  sumažina nespecifinę baltymų adsorbciją [52].  DNR aptamerų įterpimas į polimero matricą  DNR aptamerai, veikiantys kaip selektyvūs atpažinimo elementai, gali  būti efektyviai integruoti į polimero matricą, siekiant sukurti pažangius  biojutiklius. Šis procesas leidžia aptamerams išlaikyti savo struktūrinį  stabilumą ir funkcionalumą, o polimero matrica užtikrina tinkamą aplinką,  kurioje aptamerai gali sąveikauti su analitėmis, tokiomis kaip baltymai ar  kitomis biologinėmis molekulėmis. You ir kt. [54] pristatė naują biojutiklio  kūrimo metodą, kuriame MIP sluoksnis suformuojamas ant stiklinio anglies  elektrodo (angl. glassy carbon electrode – GCE) dalyvaujant amiloido-β  oligomerų (AβO) šabloninėms molekulėms, kurios veikia kaip dirbtiniai  antikūnai, pasižymintys dideliu specifiškumu mėginių matricoms. AβO  molekulės gali būti selektyviai užregistruotos mėginiuose, o nespecifiniai  junginiai pašalinami, formuojant „sumuštinio“ struktūrą kartu su aptamerais.  Šis MIP-aptamero „sumuštinio“ tipo biojutiklis, optimaliomis sąlygomis,  pasižymi itin dideliu specifiškumu ir jautrumu. Naudojant tinkamus MIP ir  aptamerus, šį metodą galima pritaikyti kitų biologinių baltymų žymenų  aptikimui, kas atveria naujas galimybes naudoti MIP ir aptamerus kaip  antikūnų alternatyvas [55]. Šie aptamerais pagrįsti polimerai yra sukurti taip,  kad selektyviai atpažintų tikslinius baltymus, kai aptameras yra integruotas į  polimero struktūrą. Šioje disertacijoje taip pat nagrinėjamas šio metodo  taikymas, kuriame aptamerai buvo integruoti į polimero matricą. Šie DNR aptamerais pagrįsti polimerai buvo sukurti taip, kad efektyviai atpažintų  kraujagyslių endotelio augimo faktorių.   Listeria monocytogenes bakterijos  Listeria monocytogenes yra gramteigiamos lazdelės formos bakterijos,  kurios geriausiai vystosi 37°C temperatūroje [56]. Šios bakterijos dažniausiai  aptinkamos dirvožemyje ir gali būti pernešamos tokių gyvūnų kaip atrajotojai,  paukščiai, jūrų gyvūnai ir vabzdžiai [58]. Jos gali užkrėsti įvairius maisto  produktus, įskaitant mėsą, nepasterizuotą pieną, daržoves ir jūros gėrybes  [59].  Šios bakterijos sukelta liga yra vadinama listeriozė, ir ji gali sukelti  infekcijas bei kitas sunkias ligas, tokias kaip septicemija ir meningitas, kurių  mirtingumas siekia 20–30% [60]. Ypač pažeidžiamos yra rizikos grupės,  tokios kaip vyresni žmonės, nėščios moterys ir asmenys su silpnu imunitetu.  Nepaisant mažo bendro sergamumo, nėščioms moterims infekcijų rizika yra  17 kartų didesnė, o listeriozės hospitalizavimo dažnis viršija 95% [61].  Listeria monocytogenes bakterijų aptikimas yra labai svarbus tiek sveikatos  apsaugai, tiek maisto saugai, nes daugelis šalių taiko griežtą nulinės  tolerancijos principą. Bakterijų buvimas kūdikių maiste ir medicininės  paskirties produktuose yra visiškai neleistinas, o kituose maisto produktuose  galiojimo laikotarpiu leidžiama ne daugiau kaip 100 KFV/g [66].  Elektrocheminiai jutikliai, pagrįsti molekulių įspaudų būdu, tampa  veiksminga priemone listeriozei aptikti. Pavyzdžiui, naudojant auksinį  elektrodą kartu su CRISPR/Cas12a sistema, buvo pasiekta 26 KFV/ml  aptikimo riba [67].  SARS-CoV-2 viruso struktūriniai baltymai  Sunkaus ūminio respiracinio sindromo koronavirusas 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  sukėlė pasaulinę sveikatos krizę, todėl Pasaulio sveikatos organizacija (PSO)  2020 m. kovo 12 d. paskelbė COVID-19 pandemija po pirminio protrūkio  Uhane, Kinijoje [71, 72]. SARS-CoV-2 yra vienos grandinės RNR virusas,  kurio genomas yra apie 29,9 kb, todėl jis yra vienas ilgiausių tarp RNR  virusų [73]. Virusui būdingi karūnos formos spygliai, kurie yra būtini užkrėsti  šeimininko ląsteles [74]. Viruso genomas koduoja keturis struktūrinius  baltymus: spyglio (rS), apvalkalo (E), membranos (M) ir nukleokapsidės (rN)  baltymus [73]. Iš pradžių dėmesys buvo sutelktas į antikūnų prieš rS baltymą  aptikimą, tačiau antikūnai paprastai susiformuoja tik antrąją infekcijos savaitę  [82, 83]. Serologiniai tyrimai, tokie kaip imunofermentinė analizė (angl.  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay – ELISA) ir šoninio srauto imunologinis  tyrimas (angl. lateral flow immunoassay – LFIA), turi tam tikrų apribojimų – jie gali užtrukti ilgai arba būti nevisiškai automatizuoti [83, 84].  Elektrocheminiai imuniniai jutikliai, dėl savo mažų sąnaudų ir paprasto  naudojimo, suteikia pranašumų diagnostikoje [89]. Šie jutikliai leidžia  nustatyti tiek antikūnus prieš SARS-CoV-2, tiek ir patį nukleokapsidės  baltymą, kuris yra svarbus viruso identifikavimui. Kadangi nukleokapsidės  baltymas mažiau linkęs mutacijoms nei spyglio baltymas, jo nustatymas gali  užtikrinti patikimesnius diagnostikos rezultatus [90, 91].   Kraujagyslių endotelio augimo faktorius  Kraujagyslių endotelio augimo faktorius (angl. vascular endothelial  growth factor, toliau – VEGF) yra baltymas, kuris suaktyvėja reaguodamas į  deguonies trūkumą (hipoksiją). Jis būtinas kraujagyslių formavimuisi  (vaskulogenezei) ir naujų kraujagyslių augimui iš esamų (angiogenezei), o šie  procesai dažnai susiję su vėžio vystymusi [92]. VEGF šeimą sudaro penki  nariai: VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D ir placentos augimo faktorius  (PLGF) [94], iš kurių VEGF-A yra tyrinėtas išsamiausiai. Šis baltymas turi  devynias proangiogenines izoformas, o dažniausiai randama yra VEGF165,  kuri glaudžiai siejama su vėžio augimu ir metastazių susidarymu [96].  VEGF aptikimas ir kiekybinis nustatymas yra itin svarbūs klinikinei  diagnostikai bei gydymo efektyvumo stebėsenai. Ankstyvas šio biožymens  identifikavimas padeda diagnozuoti vėžį ir yra susijęs su įvairiomis ligomis,  tokiomis kaip reumatoidinis artritas [98], psoriazė [99] ir Alzheimerio  liga [100]. VEGF aptikimui buvo sukurta daugybė metodų, pasitelkiant  skirtingas elektrodų medžiagas ir technologijas. Viena iš metodikų apjungia  lanksčias šilko baltymų matricas su laidžiais rašalais ir pasiekia aptikimo ribą  – 1,03 pg/mL, o tiesinis diapazonas svyruoja nuo 1 pg/mL iki 1 µg/mL [101].  Kitas  metodas  naudoja  spausdinto  montažo  auksinį  elektrodą,  funkcionalizuotą molekuliniu būdu įspaustu polimeru, kuris pasiekia ypač  žemą aptikimo ribą, kuri yra 0,005 pg/mL tiesininiame diapazone nuo  0,01 pg/mL iki 7000 pg/mL [102]. Šis metodas išryškina MIP technologijos  derinimo su antikūnais konjuguotomis nanoliposomomis veiksmingumą,  leidžiantį itin jautriai aptikti VEGF. Kita technika, naudojanti poli(o- fenilendiaminą) ant grafeno nanojuostų ir aukso nanodalelėmis modifikuotą  stiklinį anglies elektrodą. Pasiektas tiesinis diapazonas buvo nuo 0,5 ng/mL  iki 500 ng/mL, su aptikimo riba – 300 pg/mL [103]. Tikslus VEGF aptikimas  yra labai svarbus siekiant geriau suprasti jo vaidmenį ligų progresavime ir  kuriant tikslines terapijas, kurios galėtų reikšmingai pagerinti klinikinius  tyrimus, ypač gydant vėžį ir lėtines uždegimines ligas. TYRIMO METODIKA  MIP pagrindu veikiančių jutiklių analizinė sistema bakterijoms aptikti  Jutikliams kurti buvo naudojami spausdinto montažo grafito elektrodai  (angl. screen-printed carbon electrodes, toliau – SPCE). Prieš suformuojant  Ppy sluoksnį, elektrodai buvo elektrochemiškai valomi naudojant 0,5 M sieros  rūgštį, atliekant 20 ciklų, kurių metu buvo suteiktas potencialas nuo –0,1 V iki  +1,2 V, o skleidimo greitis buvo 0,1 V/s. Norint sumažinti Listeria  monocytogenes bakterijų virulentiškumą ir išlaikyti jų struktūrą, 109 KFV/ml  bakterijų suspensija buvo paveikta 70% etanolio tirpalu ir 24 valandas  veikiama UV spinduliuote. Šis apdorojimo procesas sunaikino bakterijų DNR,  tačiau minimaliai paveikė jų formą ir ląstelės sieneles. Išlaikyta bakterijų  formos struktūra yra labai svarbi molekuliniu būdu įspaustų polimerų kūrimui.   MIP sluoksnio formavimas vyko keliais etapais. Visų pirma, polipirolo  pasluoksnis buvo suformuotas naudojant 0,5 M pirolo tirpalą, suteikiant  sistemai penkių pulsų seką (+950 mV 1 sekundę, 0 V 30 sekundžių). Tuomet  į tą patį pirolo tirpalą buvo pridėta 109 KFV/ml Listeria monocytogenes  bakterijų, ir ta pati pulsų seka buvo naudojama antrajam sluoksniui  suformuoti. Vėliau, elektrodai buvo inkubuojami skirtinguose ekstrahavimo  tirpaluose: 0,05 M sieros rūgštyje, 10% acto rūgštyje, 0,1% L‑lizino tirpale ir  10 V/ml tripsino tirpale, 37 °C temperatūroje 30 minučių, kad būtų pašalintos  įspaustos bakterijos ir užbaigtas MIP sluoksnio formavimas. Kontrolinis  neįspausto polimero (NIP) sluoksnis buvo formuojamas analogiškai, tik  nepridedant bakterijų į pirolo tirpalą. Po sluoksnių formavimo MIP ir NIP  modifikuoti  elektrodai  buvo  analizuojami  naudojant  impulsinę  amperometriją, suteikiant sistemai 10 pulsų seką (+600 mV ir 0 V (po  2 sekundes kiekvienam impulsui)).  SAM pagrindu veikiančių imuninių jutiklių analizinė sistema  antikūnų prieš rS baltymą aptikti  Siekiant sukurti SAM pagrindu veikiančius imuninius jutiklius, skirtus  aptikti antikūnus prieš SARS-CoV-2 spyglio baltymą (rS), buvo būtina  kruopščiai paruošti elektrodų paviršius. Tam buvo pasirinkti du elektrodų  tipai: kvadratinis aukso elektrodas (Au(s)) ir auksu dengti mikroskopiniai  stikleliai (Au(MS)). Abu pasirinkti elektrodai buvo specialiai apdoroti,  funkcionalizuoti ir apibūdinti naudojant elektrocheminius metodus.  Kvadratiniai aukso elektrodai (Au(s)), kurių paviršiaus plotas buvo 2 cm2  ir pagaminti iš 99,9% gryno aukso, buvo poliruojami ir valomi NaBH4 tirpalu.  Po kiekvieno eksperimento jie buvo pakartotinai naudojami, atliekant tą patį  paruošimo procesą. Ant jų paviršiaus buvo suformuotas 11-MUA monosluoksnis, pamerkiant elektrodą 18-ai valandų į 1 mM 11-MUA  metanolio tirpalą. Po to elektrodas buvo plaunamas dejonizuotu vandeniu.  Toliau elektrodas pamerkiamas į 20 mM 1-etil-3-(3-dimetilaminopropil)  karbodiimido (EDC) ir 5 mM N-hidroksisukcinimido (NHS) tirpalų mišinį, ir  laikomas  20 min.  Elektrodas  nuplaunamas dejonizuotu  vandeniu,  pamerkiamas į 50 µg⸱mL−1 rS tirpalą ir laikomas 45 min.  Mikroskopiniai, 20 x 30 mm dydžio stikleliai prieš naudojimą buvo  valomi 2-propanoliu ir panardinami į ultragarso vonelę 15 minučių. Po šio  proceso, stikleliai buvo panardinti į koncentruotą H2SO4 tirpalą 30 minučių ir  vėliau išdžiovinti naudojant N2 dujų srautą (99,99% grynumo). Išdžiovinti  stikleliai buvo patalpinti į vakuuminę magnetrono kamerą, kurioje dangos  nusodinimas buvo pradėtas tik pasiekus bent 7·10-8 Torr vakuumą. Pirmiausia  ant stiklelių paviršiaus buvo padengtas plonas, apie 10 nm storio titano  sluoksnis, kuris pagerino aukso sukibimą su stiklo paviršiumi. Po to buvo  padengtas 100 nm storio aukso sluoksnis, suformuojant auksinį elektrodą  (Au(MS)). Šio darbinio elektrodo geometrinis plotas – 0,179 cm2. Au(MS)  elektrodai buvo inkubuojami 4 valandas mišraus 1 mM SAM tirpalu, sudarytu  iš 6-MCOH ir 11-MUA (santykiu 9:1).  Po to, kai Au(MS) elektrodai buvo  nuplauti ir nudžiovinti, SAM sluoksnis buvo aktyvuotas EDC/NHS tirpalu. Po  aktyvacijos, Au(MS) elektrodai buvo inkubuojami 45 minutes rS baltymų  tirpalu. Likę aktyvūs esteriai buvo užblokuoti 0,5% jaučio serumo albumino  tirpalu, o vėliau ant paviršiaus buvo imobilizuoti anti-rS antikūnai.   Au(s) ir Au(MS) elektrodai buvo elektrochemiškai charakterizuojami  naudojant ciklinę voltamperometriją (CV) ir elektrocheminę impedanso  spektroskopiją (EIS). Eksperimentai buvo atlikti trijų elektrodų sistemoje,  naudojant redokso mediatorių (2,5 mmol/L K4[Fe(CN)6] ir 2,5 mmol/L  K3[Fe(CN)6] 10 mmol/L PBS, 7,4 pH, tirpale), siekiant įvertinti elektrodų  elektrocheminį atsaką skirtinguose modifikacijos etapuose ir patikrinti  elektrodų tinkamumą imuninių jutiklių taikyme.  Analizinės sistemos kūrimas SAM pagrindu sukurtiems MIP  jutikliams rN baltymo aptikimui  SAM sluoksnis buvo formuojamas ant spausdinto montažo aukso  elektrodų (Au(SPE)), inkubuojant juos 20 °C temperatūroje 2 valandas  10 mmol/L 11-(1H-pirol-1-yl)-undekano-1-tiolio (PUT) etanolio tirpale. Po  inkubacijos elektrodai buvo nuplauti dejonizuotu vandeniu ir išdžiovinti azoto  srautu. Po to ant SAM modifikuotų elektrodų buvo elektrochemiškai  suformuotas polipirolo sluoksnis, naudojant polimerizacijos tirpalą, sudarytą  iš 25 mmol/L pirolo ir 25 µg/mL rN baltymo. Polimerizacija buvo vykdoma  naudojant dešimt potencialo pulsų (+950 mV 1 sekundę, po to 0 V 30 sekundžių), taip suformuojant struktūrą Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN), sudarytą  įterpiant rN baltymą į polipirolo sluoksnį. Norint pašalinti rN baltymą ir  sukurti molekuliniu būdu įspaustą polimerą, elektrodai buvo inkubuojami  10 minučių 0,1 mol/L sieros rūgšties tirpale. Šis procesas sukūrė MIP  struktūrą  su  ertmėmis,  atitinkančiomis  rN  baltymo  formą  (Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP). Kontroliniai elektrodai buvo paruošti tokiu pačiu būdu,  tačiau nenaudojant rN baltymo (Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP).  Jutiklio gebėjimas aptikti rN baltymą buvo įvertintas inkubuojant  5 minutes Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP elektrodus su skirtingomis rN baltymo  koncentracijomis (nuo 0 iki 35 nM) , naudojant redokso mediatorių  (2,5 mmol/L K4[Fe(CN)6] ir 2,5 mmol/L K3[Fe(CN)6] 10 mmol/L PBS,  7,4 pH, tirpale). Elektrocheminiai matavimai buvo atliekami pasitelkiant EIS  ir KBV metodus. EIS matavimai buvo vykdomi esant atviros grandinės  potencialui (angl. open circuit potential, toliau – OCP), naudojant 10 mV  amplitudę ir dažnių diapazoną nuo 100 kHz iki 0,1 Hz. KBV eksperimentai  buvo atliekami 4 mV žingsniu, 20 Hz dažniu ir 50 mV impulsų dydžiu  potencialų diapazone nuo –0,4 V iki +0,6 V. EIS duomenys buvo  analizuojami naudojant Randles ir ekvivalentines schemas, siekiant įvertinti  elektrodų elektrinį atsaką ir biologinio jutimo tinkamumą.  Aptamerais pagrįsto jutiklio analitinės sistemos kūrimas VEGF baltymo  aptikimui  Prieš modifikavimą polimeriniu sluoksniu, SPCE elektrodai buvo valomi  elektrochemiškai, atliekant ciklinę voltamperometriją 0,5 M sieros rūgšties  tirpale. Valymas vyko naudojant 20 ciklų, suteikiant 0,1 V/s greitį, potencialo  diapazone nuo –0,1 V iki +1,2 V. Polimero sluoksnio formavimas buvo  vykdomas naudojant dviejų etapų elektrocheminę polimerizaciją. Pirmajame  etape naudojant 5 potencialų impulsų seką (+0,95 V 1 s, po to 0 V 30 s) buvo  suformuotas Ppy pasluoksnis naudojant tirpalą, sudarytą iš 0,1 mol/L pirolo.  Antrajame etape į polimerizacijos tirpalą buvo pridėtas anti‑VEGF aptameras,  ir pakartota ta pati 5 pulsų seka. Šis metodas leido integruoti anti-VEGF  aptamerą į Ppy sluoksnį, taip užtikrinant jo stabilumą ir tvirtą susirišimą  polimero  struktūroje.  Įterpti  aptamerai  į  polimero  matricą  buvo  charakterizuojami naudojant impulsinę amperometriją. Matavimai buvo  vykdomi naudojant dešimt potencialo pulsų (+600 mV 2 sekundes, po to 0 V  2 sekundes). REZULTATŲ APTARIMAS  MIP taikymas kuriant elektrocheminius jutiklius, skirtus aptikti  Listeria  monocytogenes bakterijas  Šiame tyrime nagrinėjamas MIP naudojimas elektrocheminiuose  jutikliuose, skirtuose aptikti Listeria monocytogenes bakterijas. Procesas  prasideda nuo MIP sluoksnių formavimo ant SPCE naudojant impulsinę  amperometriją.  Pirmiausia  elektrodo  paviršiuje  elektrochemiškai  suformuojamas Ppy pasluoksnis, apsaugantis nuo tiesioginio bakterijų sąlyčio  su elektrodu. Vėliau jutimo sluoksnis formuojamas polipiroliu, į kurį kartu  integruojami Listeria monocytogenes bakterijų šablonai. Pašalinus bakterijas,  lieka jų įspaudai, dėl kurių susidaro selektyvus MIP sluoksnis, gebantis tiksliai  atpažinti bakterijas.   Siekiant pašalinti bakterijų šablonus iš MIP sluoksnių ir užtikrinti jų  tikslų veikimą, buvo išbandyti keli ekstrakcijos metodai. Pirmasis šablonų  ekstrakcijos metodas buvo pagrįstas NIP ir MIP inkubavimu acto rūgšties  tirpale. Acto rūgštis yra silpna organinė rūgštis, kenksminga daugumai  bakterijų net esant vos 0,5 % koncentracijai. Be kitų neigiamų poveikių, acto  rūgšties anijonas sukelia viduląstelinio pH sumažėjimą ir trikdo tam tikras  metabolines grandines [105]. Dėl to ląstelės membranoje susidaro skylės, pro  kurias išteka citoplazma ir ląsteliniai organoidai. Skenuojančios elektroninės  mikroskopijos (SEM) vaizdai parodė, kad bakterijų ląstelių paviršiuje atsirado  nelygios, šiurkščios duobutės, kas patvirtino, jog ekstrakcija naudojant acto  rūgštį buvo itin veiksminga (10 pav., 43 psl.). Vis dėlto, Listeria  monocytogenes bakterijų atsparumas rūgštims yra nuspėjamas molekulinis  atsakas, užtikrinantis ląstelių išlikimą nepalankioje aplinkoje. Kitų tyrėjų  morfologiniai tyrimai parodė padidėjusį bakterijų viduląstelinį išlikimą bei  rūgštims prisitaikiusių Listeria monocytogenes ląstelių vystymąsi vakuolėse  ir citoplazmoje [110]. Dėl šios priežasties tolimesniuose tyrimuose acto  rūgšties nebuvo naudojama. Kitu ekstrakcijos reagentu buvo pasirinktas  fermentas tripsinas, kuris selektyviai hidrolizuoja ląstelių sienelių baltymus  [106] nepažeisdamas Ppy matricos. Naudojant tripsiną, MIP jutikliai pasiekė  didesnį srovės tankį nei NIP (11 pav., 45 psl.), o selektyvi ekstrakcija pagerino  jutiklio jautrumą ir specifiškumą, užtikrindama visišką bakterijų šablonų  pašalinimą.  Elektrocheminis jutiklių charakterizavimas buvo atliktas naudojant  impulsinę amperometriją. MIP modifikuoti elektrodai rodė žymiai didesnį  atsaką į skirtingas Listeria monocytogenes koncentracijas, palyginti su NIP  elektrodais. Šie MIP jutikliai pasiekė aptikimo ribą – 70 KFV/mL, o  nustatymo riba buvo 210 KFV/mL (12 pav., 46 psl.). Molekulinio įspaudimo efektyvumas buvo įvertintas naudojant įspaudimo koeficientą (IF), kuris  apskaičiuojamas kaip MIP ir NIP jutiklių atsako kreivės polinkio  santykis [113]. Tyrimo rezultatai parodė, kad MIP įspaudimo koeficientas  buvo apie 3,93. Kadangi IF vertė, didesnė nei 1, tai gali reikšti gerą  molekulinio įspaudimo kokybę ir stiprų specifiškumą tikslinei analitei [111].  Rezultatai patvirtina, kad MIP pagrįsti elektrocheminiai jutikliai turi  galimybę jautriai ir selektyviai aptikti Listeria monocytogenes bakterijas.  Naudojant tripsiną kaip ekstrakcijos reagentą, padidėja įspaustų bakterijų  pašalinimo efektyvumas, kas pagerina jutiklio veikimą. Šie tyrimai rodo, jog  MIP pagrįsti jutikliai yra perspektyvūs diagnostikos taikymams realiomis  sąlygomis.  SAM modifikuotų aukso elektrodų taikymas kuriant imuninius jutiklius,  skirtus aptikti antikūnus prieš SARS-CoV-2 spyglio baltymus  Šiame tyrime analizuojamas aukso elektrodų modifikavimas, naudojant  SAM, siekiant sukurti imuninį jutiklį, skirtą aptikti antikūnus prieš SARS- CoV-2 rS baltymus. Modifikavimui buvo naudojami tiek kvadratiniai aukso  elektrodai (Au(s)), tiek auksu padengti mikroskopiniai stikleliai (Au(MS)),  ant kurių paviršiaus buvo suformuotas SAM. Norint įvertinti šių SAM  modifikacijų poveikį elektrodo laidumui ir bendrajam jutiklio veikimui, buvo  taikomi elektrocheminiai metodai, tokie kaip ciklinė voltamperometrija (CV)  ir elektrocheminio impedanso spektroskopija (EIS). Iš pradžių Au(s)  elektrodai buvo modifikuoti 1 mM 11‑merkaptoundekano rūgštimi (11- MUA), kad būtų suformuotas SAM sluoksnis, o Au(MS) elektrodai buvo  modifikuojami 1 mM mišriu SAM etanoliniu tirpalu (SAMmix), sudarytu iš  6-merkapto-1-heksanolio (6‑MCOH) ir 11-MUA (moliniu santykiu 1 : 9).  Ant Au(s) elektrodų susiformavęs 11-MUA SAM sluoksnis sukūrė  stabilų ir gerai organizuotą monosluoksnį. Dėl to žymiai sumažėjo srovės  atsakas (14 pav., 51 psl.), nes buvo blokuojamas elektronų perdavimas.  Kadangi 11-MUA modifikuoti elektrodai nebeužtikrino pakankamo elektronų  perdavimo, tolesniems tyrimams, taikant CV metodą, buvo pasirinkti  SAMmix modifikuoti Au(MS) elektrodai. SAMmix buvo naudojamas  siekiant išlaikyti stabilumą ir tuo pačiu leisti redokso mediatoriams pasiekti  elektrodo paviršių, taip sumažinant struktūrinių defektų kiekį. CV matavimai  parodė, kad SAMmix sumažino srovės tankį nuo 712,4 ± 5,9 μA·cm−2 iki  504,6 ± 19,3 μA·cm−2, kas rodo ribotą, bet vis dar pakankamą elektronų  perdavimą (14 pav., 51 psl.). Vėliau, aktyvinus 11-MUA karboksi grupes  naudojant EDC‑NHS tirpalą, srovės tankis šiek tiek padidėjo iki  513,1 ± 6,6 μA·cm−2, kas pagerino elektronų perdavimą prieš imobilizuojant  rS baltymą. Baltymo sluoksnio imobilizacija dar labiau sumažino srovės tankį iki 459,6 ± 9,3 μA·cm−2, nes baltymų sluoksnis sukūrė papildomą barjerą. EIS  matavimai suteikė išsamesnės informacijos apie krūvio pernašos varžą (Rct),  susijusią su kiekvienu modifikavimo etapu (15 pav., 52 psl.). Au(s) elektrodų  atveju Rct padidėjo nuo 96,2 ± 1,2 Ω·cm2 iki 10,6 ± 0,2 kΩ·cm2 po SAM  sluoksnio susiformavimo, pabrėžiant izoliacines 11-MUA sluoksnio savybes.  Aktyvinimas SAM karboksi grupių, naudojant EDC-NHS, sumažino Rct iki  5,67 ± 0,09 kΩ·cm2, palengvindamas elektronų perdavimą, o rS baltymo  imobilizavimas vėl padidino Rct iki 12,3 ± 0,27 kΩ·cm2. Priešingai, Au(MS)  elektrodų Rct padidėjo nedaug – nuo 98,2 ± 1,2 Ω·cm2 iki 803 ± 10 Ω·cm2 po  SAMmix susidarymo ir iki 1202 ± 23 Ω·cm2 po baltymų imobilizavimo, tai  rodo, kad buvo pasiektas stabilumo ir elektronų perdavimo galimybių  balansas.  Imuninio jutiklio, skirto anti-rS aptikimui, analizė parodė, kad jo  aptikimo riba yra 2,78 nM, o nustatymo riba siekia 9,17 nM, remiantis EIS  matavimais (16 pav., 54 psl.). Šie rezultatai pabrėžia SAMmix modifikuotų  Au(MS) elektrodų efektyvumą, leidžiantį tiksliai ir selektyviai aptikti  antikūnus prieš SARS‑CoV‑2 spyglio baltymus. Paviršiaus modifikavimo  procesai – nuo SAM sluoksnio susiformavimo iki baltymų imobilizavimo –  buvo esminiai, tobulinant elektrodų elektrochemines savybes ir gerinant  imuninio jutiklio veikimą. Tyrimas išryškina paviršiaus chemijos svarbą  optimizuojant elektrodų funkcionalumą specifiniams elektrocheminiams  tikslams, ypač kuriant patikimas diagnostikos priemones antikūnų prieš  SARS-CoV-2 baltymų aptikimui.  SAM modifikuotų aukso elektrodų taikymas kuriant MIP jutiklius,  siekiant aptikti SARS-CoV-2 nukleokapsidės baltymą  SARS-CoV-2 nukleokapsidės baltymo aptikimas, naudojant SAM  pagrindu veikiančią MIP metodiką, pagerino jutiklio veikimą, nes buvo  sukurta stabili sąsaja tarp spausdinto montažo auksinio elektrodo (Au(SPE))  ir polimero sluoksnių. Ant Au(SPE) elektrodo suformuotas SAM sluoksnis  (Au(SPE)/SAM) veikė kaip tarpinis sluoksnis tarp elektrodo ir jutimo  sluoksnio. Alkantiolis buvo sudarytas taip, kad jo pradinė grupė buvo  modifikuota pirolu (PUT). Šis SAM užtikrino stabilų polipirolo jutimo  sluoksnio susidarymą, o kartu su MIP formavimu buvo sukurtas kompozitas,  kuris  užtikrino  komplementarių  vietų  susidarymą  SARS-CoV-2  nukleokapsidės baltymui atpažinti. Toks modifikavimas padidino jutiklio  stabilumą, veiksmingai pagerino sąveiką su tikslinėmis molekulėmis ir  užtikrino didesnį jautrumą bei specifiškumą, kas yra itin svarbu jutiklių  veikimui. Elektrodų Au(SPE)/SAM elektrocheminis tyrimas buvo atliktas  naudojant KBV ir EIS metodus. Rezultatai parodė, kad po SAM sluoksnio  susidarymo srovės tankis sumažėjo, o krūvio pernašos varža (Rct) padidėjo,  kas rodo pasikeitusias elektrodo paviršiaus savybes. Nyquist diagramos  (18 pav., B dalis, 57 psl.) suteikė papildomų įžvalgų apie elektrodo paviršiaus  pokyčius. KBV analizė parodė, kad po Ppy elektropolimerizacijos  Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy elektrodas pasižymėjo didesne srovės amplitude,  palyginti su Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) elektrodu (18 pav., A dalis, 57 psl.). Tai  siejama su mažesniu Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy elektrodo sluoksnio storiu. Po  šablono ekstrahavimo iš Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) elektrodų, srovės tankis  padidėjo iki 0,44 ± 0,03 mA·cm², palyginus su Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP reikšme  (0,19 ± 0,06 mA·cm²), kas rodo, jog susidarė įspaustos ertmės, pagerinančios  krūvio pernašą.  EIS  tyrimas  papildomai  charakterizavo  Au(SPE)/SAM/Ppy  ir  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN) elektrodus, naudojant tą patį redokso mediatorių  [Fe(CN)6]3⁻/4⁻ (18 pav., B dalis, 57 psl.). Pašalinus nukleokapsidės šabloną iš  Au(SPE)/SAM/(Ppy+rN), buvo pastebėta padidėjusi elektronų pernaša ir  mažesnė varža. Nors Nyquist diagrama neparodė ryškių pokyčių po šablono  pašalinimo, Bode diagrama (19 pav., 58 psl.) leido geriau įžvelgti šiuos  dinamikos pokyčius. SEM vaizdai (20 pav., 59 psl.) taip pat patvirtino  skirtumus tarp palygintų paviršių: Au(SPE) elektrodas (20 pav., A dalis)  apvalios struktūros, Au(SPE)/SAM/NIP elektrodas (20 pav., B dalis)  pasižymėjo asfalto tipo paviršiumi, o Au(SPE)/SAM/MIP elektrodas (20 pav.,  C dalis) atskleidė ertmes paviršiuje, patvirtinančias sėkmingą MIP  susidarymą.  Jutiklio gebėjimas aptikti rN baltymą buvo ištirtas naudojant įvairias  elektrochemines eksperimentines sąlygas. KBV ir EIS matavimai buvo  panaudoti siekiant nustatyti aptikimo ir nustatymo ribas. Nors KBV metodu  šios ribos nebuvo apskaičiuotos dėl paskutinio taško neįtraukimo į tiesinę  lygtį, EIS metodas atskleidė atitinkamas reikšmes – 0,2 nM ir 0,66 nM (21  pav., 60 psl.). Šie rezultatai rodo, kad SAM pagrindu veikianti MIP metodika  prisideda prie geresnio jutiklių jautrumo ir specifiškumo, leidžiančio tiksliai  aptikti rN baltymą ir pasižyminčio aukštu selektyvumu. Šie rezultatai pabrėžia  MIP modifikuotų Au(SPE)/SAM elektrodų potencialą kuriant itin jautrius  jutiklius.  VEGF baltymo nustatymas, naudojant aptamerų pagrindu veikiantį  elektrocheminį jutiklį  Šiame tyrime buvo sukurtas elektrocheminis jutiklis kraujagyslių  endotelio augimo faktoriui aptikti, panaudojant aptamerus, integruotus į polipirolo matricą (Ppy/anti-VEGF). Šis integravimas leido sukurti  kompozitą, jungiantį polipirolo laidžias savybes su aptamerų specifine sąveika  su VEGF. Svarbi šio jutiklio konstrukcijos dalis buvo plono Ppy pasluoksnio  naudojimas, kuris padidino jutiklio stabilumą ir veikimo efektyvumą. Ppy  pasluoksnis pagerino aptamerų sluoksnio sukibimą su elektrodo paviršiumi ir  sumažino tiesioginę sąveiką tarp elektrodo ir aptamero. Sumažinus tokią  sąveiką, Ppy sluoksnis prisidėjo prie stabilios ir atkuriamos kompozito  Ppy/anti-VEGF jutiklio sistemos, kas yra itin svarbu tiksliam VEGF  aptikimui.  Aptamerai įterpti į polipirolo matricą buvo suformuoti ant SPCE  elektrodų, naudojant dviejų etapų elektrocheminio nusodinimo metodą.  Pirmame etape buvo nusodintas Ppy pasluoksnis, skirtas padengti ir apsaugoti  elektrodo paviršių. Antrame etape į Ppy matricą buvo įterpti anti-VEGF  aptamerai sukuriant jutiklio sluoksnį, galintį prisijungti VEGF baltymą.   Modifikuotų elektrodų elektrocheminis charakterizavimas buvo atliktas  naudojant impulsinę amperometriją. Tyrimo metu buvo registruojamos srovės  pokyčių reikšmės 0,1 s, 0,2 s, 0,4 s, 0,6 s, 0,8 s ir 2,0 s laiko intervalais  (24 pav., 64 psl.). Remiantis šiais matavimais, buvo sudarytos kalibracinės  kreivės, kurios atskleidė stiprią sąveiką tarp VEGF baltymo ir aptamerais  modifikuoto paviršiaus (25 pav., 66 psl.). Langmiur adsorbcijos izoterminis  modelis leido toliau analizuoti adsorbcijos dinamiką, o rezultatai parodė, kad  pusiausvyros konstanta (K) padidėjo nuo 1,25 ± 0,09 nM iki 2,47 ± 0,49 nM,  kas rodo ilgesnį sąveikos laiką ir jutiklio jautrumo padidėjimą esant  didesnėms VEGF koncentracijoms.  PAD matavimai atskleidė, kad Ppy/anti-VEGF modifikuoti elektrodai  gali aptikti VEGF koncentracijas net iki 0,21 nM. Siekiant geriau suprasti  jutiklio veikimą, buvo analizuojamos Ansono diagramos, kurios padėjo  įvertinti krūvio ir laiko santykį elektrocheminiuose procesuose. Šiuo tikslu  buvo pritaikyta integruota Cottrell lygtis, leidžianti detaliau interpretuoti  gautus rezultatus. Pasitelkiant šią lygtį, buvo apskaičiuotas adsorbuotos  medžiagos krūvis MIP ir NIP elektrodams, o rezultatai atskleidė afininę  sąveiką tarp aptamero ir VEGF baltymo. Be to, buvo nustatyta aptikimo riba,  kuri siekė 0,21 nM, pabrėžiant jutiklio jautrumą. IŠVADOS  1.  Naudojant elektrinio potencialo impulsus, buvo suformuotas polipirolo  pasluoksnis bei molekulinias įspaudais modifikuoto polipirolo sluoksnis,  kurie buvo integruoti į elektrocheminio jutiklio skirto aptikti Listeria  monocytogenes bakterijas konstrukciją. Šio jutiklio aptikimo riba buvo  70 KFV/mL, o nustatymo riba – 210 /KFU/mL.  2.  Įvertintos savitvarkiais monosluoksniais modifikuotų aukso elektrodų  elektrocheminės savybės, buvo nustatyta, kad 11-merkaptoundekano  rūgšties savitvarkis monosluoksnis suformuotas ant Au(s) elektrodo  sudaro izoliacinį sluoksnį, kuris žymiai padidina krūvio pernašos varžą.  Tuo tarpu ant Au(MS) elektrodo suformuotas mišrus savitvarkis  monosluoksnis  (sudarytas  iš  6-merkapto-1-heksanolio  ir  11-  merkaptoundekano rūgšties), pasižymi mažesne krūvio pernašos varža,  todėl yra tinkamas imuninio jutiklio, skirto aptikti antikūnus prieš SARS- CoV-2 spyglio baltymus nenaudojant elektrocheminių žymenų, kūrimui.  Sukurto jutiklio aptikimo riba – 2,78 nM ir  nustatymo riba – 9,17 nM.  3.  Spausdinto montažo aukso nanostruktūromis modifikuoti elektrodai gali  būti modifikuojami savitvarkių monosluoksnių pasluoksniais ir  molekulių įspaudais modifikuoto polipirolo sluoksniais. Tokios  struktūros yra tinkamos SARS-CoV-2 viruso nukleokapsidės baltymų  aptikimui. Elektrocheminiais analizės metodais buvo nustatytas krūvio  pernašos varžos didėjimas tiriamajame tirpale didėjant SARS‑CoV‑2  viruso nukleokapsidės baltymo koncentracijai. Jutiklio aptikimo riba –  0,2 nM, naudojant elektrocheminio impedanso spektroskopiją, o  nustatymo riba – 0,66 nM.  4.  Spausdinto montažo anglies elektrodai gali būti modifikuojami polipirolo  pasluoksniu bei polipirolo sluoksniu su įterptais savaime susirenkančiais  DNR aptamerais, sudarytais iš trijų atskirų DNR grandinių. Buvo  nustatyta, kad taip modifikuoti elektrodai yra tinkami VEGF baltymo  aptikimui ir jų aptikimo riba yra 0,21 nM. Impulsinės amperometrijos  metodo panaudojimas tokiuose jutikliuose supaprastina analizę, kadangi  nereikia naudoti redoks tarpininkų.

Abstract: Detecting bacteria—Listeria monocytogenes—is an essential healthcare and food industry issue. The objective of the current study was to apply platinum (Pt) and screen-printed carbon (SPCE) electrodes modiﬁed by molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) in the design of an electrochemical sensor for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes. A sequence of potential pulses was used to perform the electrochemical deposition of the non-imprinted polypyrrole (NIP-Ppy) layer and Listeria monocytogenes-imprinted polypyrrole (MIP-Ppy) layer over SPCE and Pt electrodes. The bacteria were removed by incubating Ppy-modiﬁed electrodes in different extraction solutions (sulphuric acid, acetic acid, L-lysine, and trypsin) to determine the most efﬁcient solution for extraction and to obtain a more sensitive and repeatable design of the sensor. The performance of MIP-Ppy- and NIP-Ppy-modiﬁed electrodes was evaluated by pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). According to the results of this research, it can be assumed that the most effective MIP-Ppy/SPCE sensor can be designed by removing bacteria with the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. The LOD and LOQ of the MIP-Ppy/SPCE were 70 CFU/mL and 210 CFU/mL, respectively, with a linear range from 300 to 6700 CFU/mL.

Introduction Listeria monocytogenes infections with Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with an optimum growing temperature at 37 ◦C [1] are among the leading causes of foodborne illness-related mortality [2]. Listeria monocytogenes is an environmental contaminant that primarily inhabits soil. Various animals (ruminants, birds, marine life, insects, ticks, and crustaceans) are carriers of bacteria [3]. Listeria monocytogenes can enter the food supply chain and contaminate a wide variety of food products, including meat products; raw, unpasteurised milk and cheeses; ice cream; raw or processed vegetables; raw or processed fruits; raw or undercooked poultry, sausages, hot dogs, and deli meats; and raw or smoked ﬁsh and other seafood [4]. Polymers 2023, 15, 1597. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15071597 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 2 of 16 One type of sickness induced by Listeria monocytogenes is very dangerous and can result in septicaemia and meningitis, with a case-fatality rate of 20–30% [5]. Another kind of disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes is a non-invasive gastrointestinal ailment that typically has no consequences. However, despite the low-level incidences of listeriosis in the general population, it remains a signiﬁcant and deadly food-borne disease with a hospitalisation rate of over 95% [6]. The major problem is that Listeria monocytogenes affects vulnerable segments of populations, including the elderly, pregnant women, unborn babies, and immunocompromised people (patients with cancer or AIDS, or after organ transplantations) [7]. Thus, pregnant women have a 17-fold increased risk of contracting invasive listeriosis [8], and the mortality associated with Listeria monocytogenes infection is responsible for 22% of fatalities in immunocompromised adults [4]. Detecting Listeria monocytogenes is an essential healthcare and food industry issue [9]. The minimal infection dose for listeriosis is 100 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of food. The majority of countries have zero tolerance towards the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in food [10]. The European Regulation on Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs does not allow the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in foods for infants and particular medical purposes. However, all food can have 100 CFU/g of the organism during its shelf life [11]. In this case, fast and precise detection of Listeria monocytogenes is required both for the healthcare and food industries. Among many methods for the identiﬁcation of Listeria monocytogenes, colony plate counting is accepted to be the ‘gold standard’ procedure [12]. The detection of Listeria monocytogenes has been proposed using several standard techniques, including surface plas- mon resonance [13], quartz crystal microbalance [14], and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [15,16]. These methods are crucial and can essentially meet the criteria for Listeria monocytogenes detection. However, they often have shortcomings and are labour- intensive, time-consuming, or complicated. In ELISA, secondary antibodies connected to an enzyme are immobilised in a well to capture Listeria antigens. These tests are used in food testing because they are straightforward, simple to interpret, and do not require much sample handling. However, they produce results in roughly 30–50 h and are not as sensitive as molecular methods. This technique has a sensitivity range of approximately 105–106 CFU/mL [17]. The electrochemical approach, in comparison, is straightforward, sensitive, time-saving, inexpensive, and simple to use, giving it several distinct beneﬁts over the other methods. Many excellent electrochemical systems have been successfully built in recent years to detect Listeria monocytogenes [18–21], including antibody- or DNA-based methods [1,12]. The exceptional selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymers towards molecularly imprinted analytes makes them appealing. Molecular imprinting can create a binding site uniquely suited to a speciﬁc molecule [22]. The molecular imprinting approach en- ables the development of particular molecular recognition sites that work on the idea of complementarity between the imprinted sites and the analyte due to its many distinctive beneﬁts, including simplicity in production, affordability, and excellent stability [23,24]. Therefore, MIPs can speciﬁcally bind the analytes of interest that serve as templates for their development [25–29]. However, due to the size, imprinting the whole cell in the polymers is exceptionally challenging [30,31]. Several studies have evaluated the suitability of MIP-based sensors for detecting Listeria monocytogenes bacteria [32–34]. Mainly two factors governing the recognition of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria should be taken into account: (i) discrimination of the bacteria by their cell shape (e.g., round or rod-shaped bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli) and (ii) chemical recognition due to the interaction of functional groups present in polymers with functional groups that are localised on the surface of the cell, e.g., cis-diol groups of the glycan chains [35]. Taking into account the emerging problems, Piletsky et al. [30] raised some questions related to the materials suitable for the modiﬁcation of electrodes by MIP-based layers. The authors of that study concluded that “success in this area will result in new paradigms for MIP Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 3 of 16 applications that both complement existing therapeutic and disposal or reuse in ﬁeld diagnostic techniques”. The current research sought to develop a MIP-based sensor for detecting Listeria monocytogenes. Firstly, the goal was to test the performance of two electrodes. Pt and SPCE were modiﬁed with a polypyrrole layer made from the polymerisation solution of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and pyrrole dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. A novelty of this study or a second approach was to determine the most efﬁcient solution for extraction. Thus, Listeria monocytogenes bacteria from imprinted cavities were extracted using trypsin and L-lysine and compared with more conventional extraction methods such as sulphuric and acetic acids. Herein, the analytical performance of electrodes modiﬁed by a non-imprinted polypyrrole (NIP-Ppy) layer and the electrodes modiﬁed with the MIP-Ppy layer were compared. Thirdly, the sensitivity (LOD and LOQ) and repeatability criteria were effectively employed to detect Listeria monocytogenes. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials and Electrochemical Measurements Listeria monocytogenes were obtained from the Bacteria Collection of Sumy State Uni- versity (Sumy, Ukraine). To preserve the antigenic structure on the Listeria monocytogenes membrane but eliminate virulence, 109 CFU/mL bacteria were immersed in 70% ethanol and placed under UV light for 24 h. This procedure allows the destruction of bacte- rial DNA with minimal inﬂuence on the cell wall and shape, which are necessary for MIP development. Pyrrole 98% (CAS# 109-97-7, Alfa Aesar, Kandel, Germany), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablets, pH 7.4 (CAS# 7647-14-5, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), sulphuric acid (96%, CAS# 7664-93-9, Lachner, Neratovice, Czech Republic), acetic acid (99.8%, CAS# 64-19-7, 99.8%, Lachner, Czech Republic), trypsin 500 U/mL (TrypZean® Solution, Sigma- Aldrich, SKU T3449-500 ML), and 0.1% (w/v) L-lysine solution in H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS# 25988-63-0) were used as received for bacteria removal from the Ppy-matrix to form the MIP-Ppy layer. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without additional puriﬁcation. All aqueous solutions were prepared in deionised water. Electrochemical characterisation of the working surfaces was performed using two systems. A potentiostat/galvanostat AUTOLAB TYPE III (ECO-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) operated by FRA2-EIS ECO-Chemie software (ECO-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used for the ﬁrst electrochemical system. The ﬁrst set of electrodes, DRP- 110 screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs), which are based on a working electrode with a geometric area of 0.126 cm2, a carbon-based counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl-based reference electrode, was purchased from Metrohm DropSens (Oviedo, Spain). For the second electrochemical system, the second set of electrodes was based on (i) a Pt disk with a 1 mm diameter sealed in glass as the working electrode, (ii) an Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl solution electrode as a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), and (iii) a Pt disk of 2 mm diameter as a counter electrode. Measurements were done in a home-made cell with a total volume of 300 µL, and electrochemical characterisation was performed using a portable potentiostat controlled by DStat interface software from Wheeler Microﬂuidics Lab (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi-70 S3400 N VP-SEM). 2.2. Pre-Treatment of Working Electrodes Pre-treatment of electrodes for the ﬁrst electrochemical system: Before the electro- chemical deposition of Ppy, the working electrodes underwent pre-treatment. A potential cycling approach was used to electrochemically clean SPCEs. The cleaning was carried out in 0.5 M sulphuric acid by 20 potential cycles in a potential range between −100 mV and +1200 mV vs. Ag/AgCl at a potential sweep rate of 100 mV/s. Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 4 of 16 Pre-treatment of electrodes for the second electrochemical system: The Pt electrode was pre-treated before electrochemical deposition following the procedure described in previous studies [36]. All solutions were thoroughly degassed just before use with a stream of nitrogen (N2). According to this procedure, the Pt electrode was rinsed with concentrated HNO3 solution in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, then rinsed with water and polished with alumina paste. Later, it was rinsed with water again and then with a solution of 10 M NaOH, then with a 5 M sulphuric acid solution in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. Electrochemical electrode cleaning was carried out in 0.5 M sulphuric acid by cycling the potential 20 times in the range between −100 mV and +1200 mV vs. Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 100 mV/s. The assessment of the bare electrode surface was performed by cyclic voltammogram. To improve the adhesion of the Ppy layer to the electrode surface, a layer of ‘platinum black’ was formed over the working electrode. The deposition of ‘platinum black’ clusters was performed in a solution of 5 mM H2PtCl6 containing 0.1 M of KCl by 10 potential cycles in the range between +500 mV and −400 mV vs. Ag/AgCl at a potential sweep rate of 10 mV/s. 2.3. Electrochemical Modiﬁcation of Electrodes by NIP-Ppy and MIP-Ppy Layers The polymerisation solution contained 0.5 M of pyrrole in PBS and was used to electrochemically deposit the NIP-Ppy layer [25]. The deposition of MIP-Ppy on Pt and SPCE electrodes was performed in several steps: (i) during the ﬁrst step, the Ppy under- layer was electrochemically deposited from polymerisation solution containing a 0.5 M solution of pyrrole, and a sequence of 5 potential pulses (of +950 mV for 1 s and 0 V for 30 s) was applied [29,36]; (ii) during the deposition of the second layer, 109 CFU/mL of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria was additionally added into the same polymerisation bulk solution and again the sequence of 5 potential pulses (of +950 mV for 1 s and 0 V for 30 s) was applied; (iii) the purpose of the third step was to remove imprinted bacteria from the formed Ppy layer by incubating electrodes in different extraction solutions to form the MIP-Ppy (0.05 M sulphuric acid, 10% acetic acid, 0.1% L-lysine, 10 U/mL trypsin for at 37 ◦C for 30 min). The NIP-Ppy-based layer was formed similarly to MIP-Ppy (only bacteria were not added), and the abovementioned extraction solutions similarly treated the NIP-Ppy-modiﬁed electrode. Pulsed amperometric detection was used to assess MIP-Ppy- and NIP-Ppy-modiﬁed electrodes utilising a sequence of 10 potential pulses of +600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl lasting for 2 s, and 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 2 s. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were calculated accord- ing to Equations (1) and (2): LOD = 3.3 σ/S (1) LOQ = 10 σ/S (2) where σ is the standard deviation and S is the slope of the linear relationship on the calibration plot. A schematic representation of electrode modiﬁcation is presented in Scheme 1. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 18      Scheme 1. Schematic representation of electrode modication.  3. Results  3.1. Electrodeposition of Molecularly Imprinted Polypyrrole  MIP-Ppy and NIP-Ppy layers were electrochemically deposited on the surface of Pt  and SPCE electrodes using a series of potential pulses. Figure 1A,B depict the prole of  the potential pulse series during the deposition of the NIP-Ppy layer on Pt and SPCE  electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical formation of the MIP-Ppy layer on Pt and  SPCE electrodes was performed in several steps as described in the experimental section,  respectively (Figure 2A,B). The rst step was based on the electrodeposition of the Ppy- based under-layer to support and cover the electrode. This Ppy-based under-layer  decreased the direct interaction of Listeria monocytogenes with the electrode surface before  forming the MIP-Ppy sensing layer. The deposited thin Ppy under-layer eﬀectively  favoured the formation of the MIP-Ppy-sensing layer during the second sensing-layer- formation step. The entrapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria acted as a template in an  upper Ppy layer (sensing layer), which, after the removal of bacteria, formed the MIP-Ppy  layer. Electrochemical Ppy deposition enabled control of the thickness of formed layers  and entrap the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria templates in the electropolymerised matrix.  The entrapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria templates were removed from the MIP-Ppy  layer by incubation in several extraction solutions.  Scheme 1.

Figure 1A,B depict the proﬁle of the potential pulse series during the deposition of the NIP-Ppy layer on Pt and SPCE electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical formation of the MIP-Ppy layer on Pt and SPCE electrodes was performed in several steps as described in the experimental section, re- spectively (Figure 2A,B). The ﬁrst step was based on the electrodeposition of the Ppy-based under-layer to support and cover the electrode. This Ppy-based under-layer decreased the direct interaction of Listeria monocytogenes with the electrode surface before forming the MIP-Ppy sensing layer. The deposited thin Ppy under-layer effectively favoured the for- mation of the MIP-Ppy-sensing layer during the second sensing-layer-formation step.

Extraction of Imprinted Bacteria from the MIP-Ppy Layer Several different extraction solutions were used to remove Listeria monocytogenes bac- teria from the MIP-Ppy layer formed on the SPCE. The ﬁrst template extraction method was based on the incubation of NIP-Ppy/SPCE, and MIP-Ppy/SPCE acetic acid solution was applied. Acetic acid is a weak organic acid harmful to most bacteria, even at con- centrations as low as 0.5 wt%. Acetic acid, among other harmful effects, leads to a drop in intracellular pH and the disruption of some metabolic chains by acetic acid anion [37]. Figure 3B represents the bacteria cells after incubation in acetic acid. As a result, the cell membrane develops holes that allow the cytosol and cytoplasmic organelles to leak out. The rough, uneven pits on the bacteria cell surface showed that the extraction by acetic acid was highly effective. However, the incubation of NIP-Ppy/SPCE and MIP-Ppy/SPCE in a sulphuric acid-containing solution revealed that the surface of formed NIP-Ppy and MIP-Ppy (Figure 3C,D) seem identical. The third template extraction solution used to remove the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria template from MIP-Ppy/SPCE was an enzyme (trypsin) solution. Trypsin catalyses the hydrolysis of cell wall proteins to form peptides. In addition, we tried to remove Listeria monocytogenes bacteria from MIP-Ppy/SPCE by L-lysine, which is a zwitterion amino acid and was expected to be efﬁcient for the dissociation and removal of bacteria from the Ppy-based matrix. However, registered results (Figure 3H) illustrate that the L-lysine-based bacteria extraction procedure was not efﬁcient compared to that based on trypsin. Moreover, L-lysine is crucial for protein synthesis and is also present in the peptidoglycan layer on the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it supports cell metabolism. Additionally, Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 7 of 16 it should be noted that trypsin has a speciﬁc target in the cell wall and does not affect the Ppy layer; this effect would be an extra advantage for the removal of bacteria-based templates and the development of MIP-Ppy-based sensor platforms. Trypsin is a well- known pancreatic enzyme that digests proteins by speciﬁcally hydrolysed peptide bonds C-terminal to the amino acid residues of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) [38]. Some studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin in inﬂammatory sites, followed by bacterial lysis. For example, Grenier demonstrated that Gram-positive bacteria from the oral cavity are more resistant to lysis than Gram-negative bacteria [39]. Meanwhile, Zhou et al. showed the same effect of the enzyme on both bacteria types (including bioﬁlm formation) in a concentration of 2 mg/mL [40]. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 18      3.2. Extraction of Imprinted Bacteria from the MIP-Ppy Layer  Several diﬀerent extraction solutions were used to remove Listeria monocytogenes  bacteria from the MIP-Ppy layer formed on the SPCE. The rst template extraction method  was based on the incubation of NIP-Ppy/SPCE, and MIP-Ppy/SPCE acetic acid solution  was applied. Acetic acid is a weak organic acid harmful to most bacteria, even at  concentrations as low as 0.5 wt%. Acetic acid, among other harmful eﬀects, leads to a drop  in intracellular pH and the disruption of some metabolic chains by acetic acid anion [37].  Figure 3B represents the bacteria cells after incubation in acetic acid. As a result, the cell  membrane develops holes that allow the cytosol and cytoplasmic organelles to leak out.  The rough, uneven pits on the bacteria cell surface showed that the extraction by acetic  acid was highly eﬀective. However, the incubation of NIP-Ppy/SPCE and MIP-Ppy/SPCE  in a sulphuric acid-containing solution revealed that the surface of formed NIP-Ppy and  MIP-Ppy (Figure 3C,D) seem identical.    Figure 3.

Figure 3.

Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 8 of 16 In contrast to trypsin, L-lysine is an amino acid that, at pH = 7.0, is a zwitterion; therefore, we expected that it can act as an efﬁcient agent for the dissociation/removal of some compounds from polymeric structures. As demonstrated by this research, 10 U/mL trypsin solution is the most efﬁcient for Listeria monocytogenes cell removal from the Ppy layer and to form MIP-Ppy. 3.3. Electrochemical Characterisation of Bacteria-Imprinted MIP-Ppy Layer The formed NIP-Ppy and MIP-Ppy layers were assessed using pulsed amperometric detection to assess the current density in a sequence of 10 potential pulses of +600 mV for 2 s and 0 mV for 2 s. The determination of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria at several different concentrations was performed using two different electrochemical systems (Figure 4). MIP-Ppy- and NIP-Ppy-modiﬁed SPCE electrodes (Figure 4A) and MIP-Ppy- and NIP- Ppy-modiﬁed Pt electrodes (Figure 4B) were incubated in a PBS solution, pH 7.4, in a concentration range of 3.4 × 106–1.0 × 108 CFU/mL Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. Figure 4 shows the dependence of the amperometric response. During the analysis, a decrease in the current with increasing bacteria concentration was observed, as usual in the redox-inactive analytes [41]. 3.3.1. Assessment of ﬁrst Electrochemical System Assessment of MIP-based sensor towards imprinted Listeria monocytogenes bacteria was performed in the concentration range from 0 to 108 CFU/mL. First, Listeria monocytogenes bacteria were eliminated from imprinted cavities using several extraction solutions, namely 10% acetic acid (Figure 5A), 0.05 M of sulphuric acid (Figure 5B), 10 U/mL of trypsin (Figure 5C), and 0.1% L-lysine (Figure 5D). As we can see from Figure 4, acetic acid was highly effective, as the current density of MIP-Ppy/SPCE was at least 12 times higher than that of NIP-Ppy/SPCE. While using the sulphuric acid solution, we observed only a slight change in the current density. However, the acid tolerance of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria is a predicted molecular response, which ensures cell survival in an unfavourable environment. The increased intracellular survival and the development of acid-adapted Listeria monocytogenes cells in the vacuoles and cytoplasm were conﬁrmed by morphological methods [42]. To avoid the acid tolerance response in Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, we tried different approaches, one of which was based on applying the enzyme trypsin. Thus, trypsin was utilised to remove the Listeria monocytogenes bacterium template from the NIP-Ppy/SPCE and MIP-Ppy/SPCE. Accordingly, the electrodes were individually treated with solutions containing trypsin (Figure 5C) and L-lysine (Figure 5D). The current density for MIP-Ppy/SPCE, treated with trypsin, increased around three times compared with that registered for NIP-Ppy/SPCE, while MIP-Ppy/SPCE treated with L-lysine showed no changes in current density. Electrochemically registered results reveal that the electrical capacitance changed after removing imprinted bacteria; acetic-acid- and trypsin-based solutions were the most suitable for extracting entrapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and the preparation of MIP-Ppy. 3.3.2. Assessment of MIP-Ppy/Pt- and NIP-Ppy/Pt-Based Electrodes After preparation, NIP-Ppy/Pt and MIP-Ppy/Pt electrodes were incubated in solutions of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria of different concentrations and evaluated using pulsed amperometric detection based on 10 potential pulses of +600 mV for 2 s and 0 mV for 2 s.

Electrochemically registered results reveal that the electrical capacitance changed after  removing imprinted bacteria; acetic-acid- and trypsin-based solutions were the most  suitable for extracting entrapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and the preparation of  MIP-Ppy.

Assessment of MIP-Ppy/Pt- and NIP-Ppy/Pt-Based Electrodes  After preparation, NIP-Ppy/Pt and MIP-Ppy/Pt electrodes were incubated in  solutions of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria of diﬀerent concentrations and evaluated using  pulsed amperometric detection based on 10 potential pulses of +600 mV for 2 s and 0 mV  for 2 s. Figure 6A–D depict the dependence of the amperometric response of the second  electrochemical system after the incubation of MIP-Ppy- and NIP-Ppy-modied platinum  electrodes in PBS, pH 7.4, with a diﬀerent concentration of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.

With diﬀerent working electrodes, including platinum, diﬀerent techniques can be  used to remove the imprinted material. Various solvents are often used to remove bacteria,  for instance, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, other acids, methanol, and mixtures of those  solvents [32,34,43]. Although challenging, extraction of the bacteria from the polymer is  essential for forming the MIPs [44]. During the formation of the MIP-Ppy structure within  Ppy, entrapped Listeria monocytogenes bacteria were removed, leaving imprinted cavities  using diﬀerent extraction solutions, including 10% acetic acid (Figure 6A), 0.05 M of  sulphuric acid (Figure 6B), 10 U/mL trypsin (Figure 6C), and 0.1% L-lysine (Figure 6D).  Unlike the MIP-Ppy/SPCE electrode, a somewhat diﬀerent situation was seen with the  MIP-Ppy/Pt electrode. Trypsin- and L-lysine-based solutions proved to be the best for  extracting Listeria monocytogenes bacteria from the Ppy layer. In the latter case, the current  density of the MIP-Ppy/Pt electrode was twice as high compared to that registered by the  NIP-Ppy/Pt electrode (Figure 6D). Trypsin proved to be eﬀective in preparing the MIP- Ppy/Pt electrode suitable for the determination of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria in a broad  concentration range.  3.4.

Determination of Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantiﬁcation As discussed, acetic acid and trypsin-based solutions were the most suitable for extracting Listeria monocytogenes bacteria entrapped within the Ppy-based layer and forming MIP-Ppy/SPCE. To assess the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ), pulsed amperometric detection-based electrochemical measurements were conducted. ∆I values were employed, respectively, for NIP-Ppy/SPCE and MIP-Ppy/SPCE, as analytical signals. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria concentration calibration logarithmic curves plotted against ∆I (µA) are shown in Figure 7. The slope for the variations in the current (I, µA) vs. concentration of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria (concentration expressed in CFU/mL) registered by the NIP-Ppy/SPCE electrode was 0.016 µA/(CFU/mL), with R2 = 0.98, while the linear regression slope for the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria imprinted MIP-Ppy/SPCE was 0.063 µA/(CFU/mL), with R2 = 0.97.

[47] argued that  an apparent imprinting factor is a more correct term for IF. According to the  measurements, the MIP-Ppy/SPCE had an apparent imprinting factor toward the Listeria  monocytogenes bacteria that was approximately four times higher than that registered by  the NIP-Ppy/SPCE electrode. The LOD and the LOQ were calculated according to  Equations (1) and (2). It was evaluated that the LOD and LOQ for the MIP-Ppy/SPCE were  70 CFU/mL and 210 CFU/mL, respectively, in the linear range from 300 to 6700 CFU/mL.

The investigation of the interaction between Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and the MIP-Ppy-modiﬁed electrode has several advantages, but the one that stands out the most is that just two of them use electrochemical techniques (Table 2). This suggests that there were only a few studies on applying MIP-based sensors for detecting Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. Additionally, Table 2 summarises other MIP-based sensors for certain bacterial species, employing electrochemical and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) approaches. The electrode, the polymer used for MIP preparation, the bacteria extraction method, the analytical method, and sensitivity (LOD and linear range) are included in Table 2. In most cases, when an enzyme was used to extract the template from the polymer during MIP- based sensor design, that enzyme was lysozyme. Meanwhile, a similar enzyme, trypsin, was employed in this study. Table 2. Summary of the MIP-based sensors for Listeria monocytogenes and other bacteria.

Conclusions This study involved the electrochemical modiﬁcation of two types of electrodes, namely, SPCE and Pt, with different Ppy layers, i.e., not imprinted (NIP-Ppy) and bacteria Listeria monocytogenes imprinted (MIP-Ppy). The pulsed amperometric detection method was used to evaluate the performance of MIP-Ppy/SPCE and MIP-Ppy/Pt electrodes. MIP- Ppy/SPCE electrodes were found to be more effective in detecting Listeria monocytogenes in terms of the substantial changes in current density. Furthermore, the study analysed the efﬁciency of various template extraction solutions on the sensor’s sensitivity. The results showed that the acetic acid solution was highly effective in removing imprinted bacteria from the MIP-Ppy layer. MIP-Ppy/SPCE exhibited at least 12 times higher current density than NIP-Ppy/SPCE. The current density increased around 3 times for MIP-Ppy/SPCE designed by extraction of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria with trypsin compared to changes in the current density registered by similarly treated NIP-Ppy/SPCE. Based on these results, it can be assumed that an efﬁcient MIP-Ppy-based sensor can be designed by extracting bacteria using acetic acid and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. The results showed that the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) of the MIP-Ppy/SPCE prepared Polymers 2023, 15, 1597 14 of 16 using trypsin were 70 CFU/mL and 210 CFU/mL, respectively, within the linear range of 300 to 6700 CFU/mL.

The self-assembled monolayer (SAM) consisting of a mixture of WC14 (20-tetradecyloxy-3,6,9,12,15,18,22-heptaoxahexatricontane-1-thiol) and β-mercaptoethanol (βME) mixed in a molar % ratio of 35:65 served as a molecular anchor for tBLMs. The ﬂuorescence microscopy (FM) allowed direct observation of incorporation of Chl-a into membranes. The lipid composition consisting of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol (Chol), was found to be highly compatible with the addition of Chl-a to the phospholipid membranes at different molar ratios. Moreover, the addition of Chl-a to DOPC yielding DOPC (50%)/Chol (40%)/Chl-a (10%) bilayers consistently decreased defect density in tBLMs, thus increasing dielectric integrity of the membranes. Also, we observed a signiﬁcant structural stabilization of tBLMs subject to bias potential variation in experiments involving Chl-a containing bilayers. © 2021 The Author(s).

[DOI: 10.1149/ 1945-7111/ac0262] Manuscript submitted February 26, 2021; revised manuscript received April 28, 2021. Published June 2, 2021. Chlorophyll (Chl-a) a is a unique π–π-conjugated system located across their macrocyclic skeleton, and the diversity of side groups around allows it to function as a major photoactive and structural component of all photosynthetic organisms.1 Since in the natural environment Chl-a is able “to harvest light,” it is capable to capture solar photons and convert their energy into chemical form, which is well accessible to nearly all forms of life.2,3 The majority of chlorophylls are situated in the thylakoid cell membrane, which may be at the spatial distance between the outer and inner cell, moreover, its composition and arrangement vary by cell type.4 Many different simpliﬁed biomimetic analogues of lipid mem- branes were widely used to evaluate/model structural and permeability/ transport properties of more complex natural bio-membranes.5,6 In some recent biophysical and biochemical studies tethered phospholipid bilayer membranes (tBLMs) attached to the gold surface are used as the model systems, which are well-mimicking properties of natural membranes. Therefore, these universal tBLM modeling platforms recently are ﬁnding a niche in the investigation of proteins, toxins, and membrane forming compounds.7–9 The tBLM is a surface supporting structure attached to the surface of a solid substrate and consists of self-assembled lipid-like molecules, which anchor a phospholipid bilayer to the surface.10 The properties of tBLM structure depend on a process, which usually starts from the formation of a self- assembled monolayer (SAM) containing a “lipid anchor” with a longer alkyl chain and short alkyl chain that forms the main part of the SAM,11 followed by the formation of a phospholipid bilayer mem- brane ﬁlled with unbound lipids. In the ﬁrst stage, thiol—or disulﬁde- groups of alkanethiols are exploited to attach synthetic lipid to the metal surface,12 which in most cases is gold.13,14 The second step involves one of two well-established procedures: (i) a solvent exchange procedure,15 or (ii) a fusion of small liposomes.16 The structure, nature, composition, and distribution of the SAM lipid anchor molecule on the substrate surface have a signiﬁcant effect on the properties of tBLM.17 Electrical impedance of tBLM, which contains the different number of defects, is an important characteristic, therefore, the concentration and the nature of defects, which are present in tBLMs, can be efﬁciently determined and/or revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), showing structural differences of differently designed tBLMs.18 The long-chain thiol compounds WC14 (20-tetradecyloxy-3,6,9,12,15,18,22-heptaoxahexatricontane-1- thiol) can be used in SAM formation as “anchors,” which enable the formation of stable and reproducible phospholipid bilayers.19 It is recognized that tBLMs mimic to a certain extent the structure and function of cell membranes.20 Speciﬁc modiﬁcations of tBLMs are suitable for the development of various biosensors by the incorporation of lipid components such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol (Chol), which provide additional stability.21,22 In our very recent research we have demonstrated the applicability of such membranes for the modelling of cell-membrane treatment by pulsed electric ﬁeld localized by scanning electrochemical microscope.23 All this enables to apply these systems in the study of various properties of biological membranes. The aim of this work was to test the possibility to incorporate photoactive compound Chl-a into tethered bilayer lipid membrane (tBLM) to create a platform, which can be used in the future for the development of tBLM photosensitive surface constructs, which could be potentially used for the development of new biosensors and biomimetic artiﬁcial leaves. Experimental Chemicals and other materials.—20-tetradecyloxy-3,6,9,12, 15,18,22-heptaoxahexatricontane-1-thiol was synthesized as de- scribed in Ref. 11 β-mercaptoethanol (⩾99.0%, CAS Number 60–24–2), sulfuric acid (95.0%–98.0%, CAS Number 7664–93–9), chloroform (⩾99%, CAS Number 67–66–3), toluene (⩾99.5%, CAS Number 108–88–3) methanol (⩾99.9%, CAS Number 67–56- –1) and silica gel (granules desiccant ∼2 −5 mm, CAS Number 112926–00–8) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (CAS Number 4235–95–4) and cholesterol (⩾99%, CAS Number 57–88–5) were received from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, USA). H2O was puriﬁed in a Millipore (Billerica, MA) UHQ reagent-grade water puriﬁcation system. Salts: NaCl (⩾99.5%, CAS Number 7647–14- –5), NaH2PO4 (⩾99.0%, CAS Number 7558–80–7), KCl (⩾99.0%, CAS Number 7447–40–7), KH2PO4 (⩾99.0%, CAS Number 7778– 77–0) were obtained from Reachem (Slovakia p. a.). Glass slides of zE-mail: gintaras.valincius@gmc.vu.lt; arunas.ramanavicius@chf.vu.lt Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 066506 2.5 × 7.5 × 1 cm dimensions were received from ThermoFisher (UK) and glass Petri dishes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Extraction of chlorophyll a.—7.2 grams of fresh spinach were bundled using porcelain mortar with pestle adding 20 ml of a toluene and methanol solution (molar ratio 8:2). The solution was ﬁltered through a Buchner funnel. For Chl-a extraction silica gel and toluene were used to load the column up to 15 cm and then adding the ﬁltrate. The column was washed with toluene until the yellow fraction containing carotenes was collected. The green fraction containing Chl-a was collected within 50 ml of a toluene-methanol solution mixed at a molar ratio of 8:2. The toluene and methanol solutions were separated from each other using a separator-funnel and then toluene solution (containing dissolved Chl-a) was evapo- rated. After the extraction Chl-a was dissolved in chloroform. Gold ﬁlm deposition.—Prior to the start of gold ﬁlm deposition, glass slides were: (i) washed in glass Petri dishes for 30 min in sulfuric acid, then (ii) washed abundantly with deionized water after pouring the solution. The slides were blotted dry with a stream of nitrogen gas (99.99%) and placed in a PVD75 (Kurt J. Lesker Co., U.S.) vacuum magnetron chamber. Film depositions begin only when a vacuum of 7 × 10–8 Torr and deeper was reached. The plates were ﬁrst coated with a thin (∼7 nm) layer of chromium (Cr) to improve the adhesion of gold (Au) to the surface of the glass. The thickness of the coated gold ﬁlm was controlled by real-time monitoring with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Formation of self-assembled monolayer (SAM).—The glass slides coated by 70 nm thick gold ﬁlm (glass/Au) were incubated for 3 h in 0.1 mM βME and WC14 ethanolic solution, containing the materials in a molar ratio of 65:35, respectively, to form a self- assembled monolayer (SAM) consisting of backﬁller βME and synthetic thiolipid WC14 molecules. After the incubation, the plates were washed with 20–30 ml of ethanol to remove excess thiols and then dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and, after this, formed glass/Au/SAMs tBLM were immediately used in all further experi- ments and the formation of glass/Au/SAMs/tBLM. Formation of tethered bilayer lipid membranes by vesicle fusion method.—Bilayer lipid membranes were formed using the method of vesicle fusion described in previously reported researches.13,21 Vesicle solutions were prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho- line (DOPC) (Avanti Lipids Alabaster, USA) and cholesterol (Chol) (Avanti Lipids Alabaster, USA) at a molar % ratio of 6:4 in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 0.1 M of NaCl (Reachem Slovakia p. a.), 0.01 M NaH2PO4 (Reachem Slovakia, p. a.), pH 4.6. In the same manner vesicle solutions were prepared from DOPC, Chol, and Chl-a at molar % ratio 5:4:1 and 6:3:1, respectively. Then, glass/Au/ SAM/tBLM was exposed to the solution of vesicle for 30 min and then rinsed with phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.137 M of NaCl, 0.01 M of NaH2PO4, 0.0027 M of KCl, and 0.0018 M of KH2PO4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based measurement setup.—Electrochemical studies were performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method using the Zahner Zennium (Kronach, Germany) electrochemical workstation, controlled by the Thales z 2.0 software package. A perturbation amplitude of 10 mV was applied for the registration of EIS spectra in the frequency range within 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. A three-electrode system was used, in which the working electrode was based on glass/Au/SAM-tBLM, while the reference electrode was a silver/(silver chloride) in saturated NaCl [Ag/AgCl/NaClsat] microelectrode M-401F, Microelectrodes (Bedford, NH) and the auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire (99.99% purity, Aldrich) of 0.25 mm diameter. The reference electrode was wrapped by a Pt-based auxiliary electrode. The surface area of the working electrode in a cell was 0.16 cm2. Measurement setup for spectrophotometric evaluation.—The spectrophotometric evaluation was performed in cuvettes of a 1 cm length optical path. Calculation of the concentration of Chl-a was performed using Lambert-Buger-Ber law and molar extension at optical absorbance maximum at λmax = 668 nm. The molar extinction coefﬁcient (ε) of Chl-a in chloroform at 665.6 nm is equal to 90.41 l × mol−1 × cm−1.24 It was determined that Chl-a concentration was 10.8 mmol l−1. Fluorescence microscopy-based measurement setup.— Fluorescence microscopy (FM) was performed to examine the optical homogeneity of tBLM.25 Cholesterol modiﬁed by ﬂuorescent agent Cy5 (Cholesterol Cy5), which has replaced 0.5% of the Chol involved into vesicle, was used for the visualization and assessment of Chol concentration in the membrane. Microscopy was performed in an aqueous medium because formed membranes are tending to decompose in the air. Therefore, an immersion water lens was used for ﬂuorescence microscopy-based measurement. The sample was illuminated with a mercury lamp light passed through a monochro- matic ﬁlter with light permeability at only a wavelength of 570 nm, which corresponds to green light. The energy of this light wave is sufﬁcient to excite the ﬂuorescence of Cy5 molecules. Fluorescence image was monitored in real-time by spectrometers Exi Aqua Qimaging (Canada) and Qcapture Silicon Graphics (USA). Results and Discussion Spectrophotometric and ﬂuorescence microscopy-based evalua- tion of tBLMs.—The absorption spectrum of Chl-a in chloroform solvent (Fig. 1A) was evaluated spectrophotometrically. Figure 1A shows the maximum absorption of light with wavelengths of 415 nm (blue) and 667 nm (red). These absorption peaks correspond well with the works of other authors.24,26 The incorporation of Chl-a into tBLMs was followed by ﬂuorescence microscopy (FM). For this purpose, 0.5% of cholesterol was labelled with a Cy5 ﬂuorescently labelled cholesterol. Its excitation wavelength is 570 nm, while the emission occurs at 650–665 nm. It coincides with the absorption peak of chlorophyll. The image of tBLMs containing only DOPC and cholesterol is displayed in Fig. 1B. The average ﬂuorescence intensity of the image was 96 ± 2 as measured in relative ﬂuorescence units (RFU). Figures 1C and 1D display images of tBLMs containing DOPC, Chol, and Chl-a at molar % ratio of 5:4:1 and 6:3:1, respectively. In the case of 5:4:1 composition, the average ﬂuorescence intensity was found to be 40 ± 3 RFU (Fig. 1C) while 6:3:1 composition exhibited a slightly higher average intensity of 49 ± 3 RFU. In both cases, an approximately two-fold decrease of the ﬂuorescence intensity was observed. Such decreases can be explained by the absorption of Chl-a a light emitted Cy5 ﬂuorophore. It is more likely that at higher concentrations of Cy5 in the composition of 5:4:1, self-quenching is more deﬁned and more Cy5 dimers can be found causing random binding to the protein (Chl-a) surface, due to its hydrophobic interactions,27 thus providing strong evidence of incorporation of chlorophyll into tBLMs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based evaluation of SAM and tBLM layers.—The characteristic electrochemical im- pedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the phospholipid bilayer membrane formation process are shown in Fig. 2. tBLMs were formed at different molar % ratios of various components: DOPC, Chol and Chl-a at molar % ratio of 5:4:1, respectively, DOPC, Chol and Chl-a at molar % ratio of 6:3:1, respectively, DOPC and Chol at molar % ratio of 6:4, respectively. The EIS spectra are presented in the Cole-Cole plots (Fig. 2 A graph: imaginary complex capacitance component ImC vs real complex capacitance component ReC). These coordinates are well suited to represent the capacitive type of impedance because of its semi-circular part of EIS spectra, which is proportional to the electrical capacitance of tBLMs.11 Figure 2A Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 066506 shows typical changes in EIS spectra after the formation of tBLM on anchor SAM. Speciﬁcally, the complex capacitance semicircle decreased about 10 times, from 8 μF·cm−2 (before the vesicle fusion and membrane formation) to 0.6–0.8 μF·cm−2 (after the formation of tBLM). This effect is explained by the formation of an approximately 3 nm21 thick dielectric layer. In this work, we tested two lipid compositions of tBLMs that can accommodate a certain amount of Chl-a. The EIS variation allowed veriﬁcation of the integrity of tBLMs at various ratios of lipids. The base composition was DOPC and Chol at a molar % ratio of 6:4. The addition of Chl-a was performed in the following sequence: DOPC was replaced with Chl-a resulting in a molar composition of 5:4:1 (DOPC/Chol/Chl-a) and then cholesterol was replaced with DOPC resulting in a molar composition of 6:3:1, respectively. We found that for different DOPC, Chol, and Chl-a ratios (in molar %) from 6:4 to 5:4:1 and 6:3:1, only slight variation of tBLM capacitance was observed, which in turn cannot be considered as statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 2C). However, if the defectiveness is analyzed, the inclusion of Chl-a into DOPC/Chol tBLMs was found to be an important factor in determining the defect densities in tBLMs. The algorithm described in28 was used to estimate the defect densities in tBLMs with and without Chl-a. The algorithm relates defect density in membranes with the position of the phase minima in the negative of impedance phase vs frequency plots (Bode phase plot). The formula to calculate approximate densities is as follows: ≈ − − − [ ] lgN lgf k lgr const 0.93 lg 0.2 def min where Ndef the defect density in μm−2, fmin the frequency of the negative of phase minimum, Hz, k = 1.6 10−6 cm2s−1, r0 = 1 nm and const = 1.24, one obtains the approximate values of defect densities in tBLMs of different composition. The calculated according to Eq. 1 defect densities are 0.87 ± 0.09 μm−2 for DOPC/Chol (6:4), 0.73 ± 0.08 μm−2 for DOPC/Chol/Chl-a (6:3:1) and 0.16 ± 0.08 μm−2 for DOPC/Chol/Chl-a tBLMs. As seen from Fig. 2D, the introduction of Chl-a into DOPC/Chol 6:4 tBLMs lowers the defectiveness, even though the decrease was found to occur in relatively narrow interval of compositions at 5:4:1 DOPC/Chol/Chl-a. In this case the defect density, Ndef was 6-fold lower compared to basic composition DOPC/Chol (6:4) and compared to DOPC/Chol/Chl-a (6:3:1) composition as well (Fig. 2D). Sharp decrease of Ndef in tBLM composition DOPC/Chol/Chl-a (5:4:1) can be explained by the presence of two defect destabilizing factors: the cholesterol, which due to its geometric shape (the cone) tends to destabilize defects formed in highly curved bilayer fragments such as transient pores. The second component, Chl-a, which exhibits an effective shape of inverted cone likely destabilizes membrane defects through the concerted action of both Chol and Chl-a leading to increased stiffness of bilayer due to a formation of complementary pairs with cholesterol.29 The effect of defect density decrease is higher in DOPC/Chol/ Chl-a (6:3:1) composition indicating a critical role of a total concentration of Chol and Chl-a. Taken together we conclude that Chl-a induces a noticeable decrease of tBLM capacitance that is consistent with lower relative dielectric constant of the hydrophobic 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2- hexadecen molecular fragment in Chl-a molecule compared to dioleoyl fragment in DOPC. The substitution of cholesterol with Chl-a does not induce the decrease of similar magnitude, thus suggesting Chl-a and Chol exhibits similar dielectric properties. Another important change of tBLM properties is related to a Figure 1. A—Optical absorption spectra of Chl-a dissolved in chloroform; Fluorescence microscopy images obtained by observing tBLM of different composition with cholesterol marked by ﬂuorophore Cy5. B,—tBLM containing DOPC and Chol at molar % ratio of 6:4, respectively; C—tBLM containing DOPC, Chol and Chl-a at molar % ratio of 5:4:1, respectively; D—tBLM containing DOPC, Chol and Chl-a at molar % ratio of 6:3:1, respectively. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2021 168 066506 signiﬁcant decrease of their defectiveness, especially when the total number of Chol and Chl-a amounts to 50% of the lipid content of the membranes. The effect of applied electrode potential on electrochemical properties of tBLM.—The bias potential is an important physical parameter potentially affecting both capacitance and defectiveness of tBLMs. One of the key requirements in experiments with variable bias potential is that the system should remain stable throughout the experiment. Stability is necessary because the EIS spectra recording experiments typically last between one and ﬁve minutes, depending on the frequency range chosen during which the systems under investigation must retain both functional and structural stability. In this work tBLMs of compositions involving Chl-a were tested and compared to compositions without Chl-a in the potential range between −0.5 and 0 V vs Ag/AgCl/NaClsat. EIS variations with potential are shown in Fig. 3. The Cole-Cole plots (Figs. 3A–3B) indicate qualitatively similar responses to bias potential change in both chlorophyll-free and chlorophyll-loaded tBLMs. Speciﬁcally, the minimum point separ- ating higher and lower frequency range semicircles in EIS spectra move “north and west” as the bias potential becomes less positive. Such spectral change as was shown in Kwak et al.30 signals about increased defect densities, triggered by the shift of bias potential into the negative range. Also, the comparison of the capacitive semicircular feature in Figs. 3A and 3B indicates some subtle differences. In particular, the semicircular EIS spectra of 6:4 DOPC and Chol tBLM tend to increase with increasing negative bias potential (Fig. 3a), while, exactly this part of the spectra in Fig. 3b remained noticeably more stable for 5:3:1 DOPC, Chol, Chl-a tBLMs. These hints both at increased defectiveness as well increased thickness of the submem- brane space and the polarization of the Helmholtz layer at metal support/submembrane interface.18,30 Such features are consistent with the idea of the bias potential induced membrane delamination process observed by Lipkowski et al.31 Such delamination may occur due to increased hydration of the submembrane layer separating solid support and phospholipid bilayer, as well as structural rearrangement in the anchor monolayer, for example, the change of the structure from gosh to trans conformation of β-mercaptoethanol, which serves as a surface backﬁller in anchor monolayers.32 Trans conformation exhibits more loos association of the OH−group with the gold support, therefore, allowing to form more hydrogen bonds with the water molecules that are present in the reservoir and in such way increase hydration level. The Bode EIS spectra support our conclusion about the decreased defectiveness of the Chl-a containing tBLMs. As seen from Figs. 3C and 3D in both cases the phase minima position, fmin, which as it was shown earlier is a good indicator of a defect density in membranes,21 shifts towards higher frequencies with negative polarization of tBLMs. The comparison of Figs. 3C and 3D indicates that the same extent of bias potential change (from 0 to −0.5 V) results in different minima shifts. In the case of 6:4, DOPC/Chol tBLMs the polarization at −0.5 V shifts fmin towards approximately Figure 2.

These changes might suggest larger defect densities. In previous studies32,33 it was demonstrated that the structural properties and the function of tethered bilayer lipid membranes (DOPC and Chol at molar % ratio 6:4) critically depend on the molecular structure of molecular anchor of the lipid bilayer. Negative electrode potential facilitates the mobility of anchor molecules on the surface by decreasing the strength of metal-adsorbate bonding. At the same time, the hydrophobic interaction between water and polymethylene chains may drive the clustering of hydrophobic molecules to minimize the energy of the system. As previously shown, clustering of molecular anchors has a detrimental effect on the integrity of tBLMs, increasing defect densities impairing the electric insulation of bilayer.33 However, the defect density is not the only factor responsible for shifts of fmin position, as it may be without deeper analysis inferred from Eq. 1. Equation 1 was derived for a condition of constancy of both the speciﬁc resistance ρsub, and thickness, dsub of submembrane space.32 If the delamination of the bilayer from the solid support occurs, then the speciﬁc resistance ρsub, decrease or thickness, dsub increase, or both would trigger fmin shifts seen in Fig. 3. It is quite likely, that the extension of an aromatic chlorin ring structure into the submembrane space in Chl-a containing tBLMs increases hydrophobicity in this space, thus precluding the delamination and increased hydration in contrast to tBLMs void of Chl-a. Not being able to specify the exact reason for observed shifts of fmin in Figs. 3D and 3C, we still may conclude that introduction of low (up to 10%, mol) amount of Chl-a into tBLMs stabilized the structural and dielectric integrity of these model bilayers, which is beneﬁcial if light-sensitive bioelectronics devices are considered. Conclusions In this study, the effect of chlorophyll a immobilization into tethered bilayer lipid membrane was evaluated. The integration of Chl-a within tBLMs was followed by ﬂuorescence microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We showed that recon- stitution of Chl-a is possible into tBLMs containing different amounts of cholesterol. The replacement of cholesterol with Chl-a does not cause signiﬁcant changes in EIS response of tBLMs thus indicating that Chl-a and Chol possess similar dielectric properties. However, a signiﬁcant decrease in membrane defectiveness was consistently observed with the introduction of Chl-a into tBLMs. We also, found that the detrimental to dielectric properties of tBLMs effects of bias negative polarization is reduced by introduction of Chl-a into tBLMs. While the exact nature of such beneﬁcial action of Chl-a is not clear, it is rather likely that the interaction of chlorine aromatic ring with the submembrane structural elements of tBLMs may be responsible for increased hydrophobicity and consequently stability of the studied tBLM constructs. The EIS and FM data conﬁrm the suitability of vesicular fusion and Chl-a transfer into Figure 3.

Abstract: The serologic diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the evaluation of vac- cination effectiveness are identiﬁed by the presence of antibodies speciﬁc to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this paper, we present the electrochemical-based biosens- ing technique for the detection of antibodies speciﬁc to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (rSpike) were immobilised on the surface of a gold electrode modiﬁed by a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). This modiﬁed electrode was used as a sensitive element for the detection of polyclonal mouse antibodies against the rSpike (anti-rSpike). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to observe the formation of immunocomplexes while cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used for additional analysis of the surface modiﬁcations. It was revealed that the impedimetric method and the elaborate experimental conditions are appropriate for the further development of electrochemical biosensors for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or the conﬁrmation of successful vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus; electrochemical immunosensor; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); cyclic voltammetry (CV); self-assembled monolayer (SAM); antigen-antibody complex; spike proteins (rSpike); speciﬁc antibodies; serological diagnosis 1. Introduction Biosensors have piqued the interest of many researchers in recent years, particularly in the realm of healthcare. They are distinguished by their rapid response time, ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules, and the ability to be miniaturized for a portable application while needing minimal sample processing when compared to conventional analytical procedures. The primary principle underlying biosensing devices is the conversion of biotarget detection into an analytical signal for further analysis. A variety of molecules including enzymes [1,2], proteins [3,4], antibodies [5,6], and nucleic acids [7,8] can be Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23126768 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 2 of 10 used as target biomolecules, with electrochemical [5,9,10], optical [11], piezoelectric [12], surface plasmon resonance [13], and other methods being commonly used for the analytical signal registration. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostic techniques based on biosensors are generally classiﬁed into two categories depending on the target compounds: molecular and serological [14]. The serological type is based on the detection of the afﬁnity interaction between antigens and speciﬁc antibodies. The determination of speciﬁc antibodies allows one to deﬁne the stage of the disease and evaluate the immune response toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The spike (S) protein is commonly used as the antigen in serological tests [15]. The SARS-CoV-2 structural S-protein is a transmembrane homotrimer that is required for viral adherence and penetration of a host cell [16,17]. Due to their low cost, simplicity, and availability for mass production, electrochemical biosensors are widely investigated in the biomedical applications [18–21]. However, electrochemical-based biosensors for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are still facing some challenges in order to be commercialised and further research is in high demand [22]. Recently, for electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2-related proteins, various elec- trochemical methods to evaluate analytical signals were reported [23–29]. The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using differential pulse voltammetry [30], chronoam- perometry [31], pulsed amperometric detection [4,7], square wave voltammetry [10], cyclic voltammetry (CV) [32,33], and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [5,9,34]. In this paper, we investigate an electrochemical-based approach for the detection of polyclonal mouse antibodies against the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (rSpike). EIS and CV were chosen as the analytical methods for evaluating the antigen-antibody interaction taking place on the working gold electrode surface since they were both simple and straightforward. It is believed that the antigen-antibody complex produces a blocking layer in the biosensing system, which causes the electron transfer resistance to increase. Due to the low amplitude of perturbation from steady-state, the EIS-based system allows non-destructive direct sensing of target biomolecules without employing enzyme labels [35]. CV is used for the evaluation of electrochemical properties of analyte solutions as well as the blockage of the electrode surface [36]. Because the target rSpike is detected on the working electrode’s surface, it is necessary to design the surface with proper protein recognition characteristics. For this purpose, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is commonly used; among these, -COOH terminated SAM was shown as one of the most appropriate for speciﬁc and stable SARS-CoV-2 S- protein immobilisation [37]. 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA), based on alkanethiols, forms a ﬁrm and dense ﬁlm and makes it possible to observe the kinetics of mediated electron passage [38]. In our previous work [29], covalent immobilization of the SARS- CoV-2 S-protein and its afﬁnity interaction with speciﬁc antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in blood serum patient samples after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (anti-rSpike) were evaluated. The anti-rSpike was quantiﬁed using CV and EIS methods, giving the limit of detection values of 2.53 nM and 1.99 nM, respectively. This research aimed to investigate the event of antigen-antibody complex formation occurring on the working electrode surface by EIS with an additional assessment of the examined surface blockage by CV. The ﬁndings of this study will serve as the foundation for the design of a biosensor powered by other electrochemical technologies. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals and Other Materials 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) (98%, CAS# 71310-21-9) and methanol (MeOH) (≥99%, CAS# 67-56-1) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (98%, CAS# 6066-82-6) and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- N’-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (≥99.0%, CAS# 25952-53-8) were purchased Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 3 of 10 from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), alumina suspension (grain diameter 0.3 µm) was received from Buehler (Lake Bluff, IL, USA). Baltymas (Vilnius, Lithuania) developed the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (rSpike). In accordance with the protocol outlined hereunder, polyclonal antibodies against rSpike (anti-rSpike) were produced. Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (USA). Ammonium sulfate (CAS# 7783-20-2, purity >99.5%) was obtained from Carl Roth (Germany). K3Fe(CN)6 (≥99.0%, CAS# 13746-66-2), K4Fe(CN)6 (≥99.0%, CAS# 14459-95-1), NaBH4 (≥98.0%, CAS# 16940-66-2), NaCl (≥99.0%, CAS# 7647-14-5), KCl (≥99.0%, CAS# 7447-40-7), NaH2PO4 (≥99.0%, CAS# 7558-80-7), K2HPO4 (≥98.0%, CAS# 7758-11-4). Deionized water was used to prepare all aqueous solutions. All reagents were of analytical-reagent grade and were used as received from the producers unless otherwise noted. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS), pH 7.4 with the presence of 2 mM K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6 ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−). PBS was prepared by dissolving 0.137 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaH2PO4, 0.0027 M KCl, and 0.0018 M of KH2PO4 in deionized water. 2.2. Protocol of Protein Puriﬁcation Hamster CHO cells obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA) (cat. no. A29127) were used for the secretion of rSpike protein. The gene, which encodes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike ectodomain including amino acids (aa) 1-1208, (UniProtKB sequence accession number: P0DTC2 (SPIKE_SARS2)) was obtained from General Biosystems (USA). This gene was integrated into the expression vector pCAGGS (Creative Biogene, cat. no. VET1375) through the restriction sites NotI and XhoI, which are added at 5′ and 3′ ends of this gene, correspondingly. These expression constructs contain these parts: (i) full- length rSpike ectodomain (aa 1–1208) without transmembrane and cytoplasmic aa, (ii) furin cleavage site ‘RRAR’ mutated to “GSAS”, (iii) C-terminal GSN4 trimerisation motif fused to protein sequence, (iv) thrombin cleavage site, and (v) Strep-tag II and His6-tag. Two mutations (K986P and V987P) were introduced into the rSpike sequence to stabilize the trimer in the pre-fusion conformation [39]. The rSpike protein was generated in CHO cells (cat. no. A29133) grown in ExpiCHO Expression System purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc’s (Vilnius, Lithuania). The Max Titer protocol was developed by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Vilnius, Lithuania) and was applied for protein transfection and expression procedures. Transfection lasted nine days, then cells were harvested from cultivation media and under refrigeration were centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 min. Then, supernatant was ﬁltered using a ﬁlter that contained cavities of 0.22-µm diameter. The supernatant was condensed and then dissolved in 50 mM PBS, pH 8.0, containing 10 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl through tangential ultraﬁltration by TFF cassette, which was supported with 100 kDa cutoff membranes (cat. no. VF20P) from Sartorius Stedim Biotech (Göttingen, Germany). The protein solution was deposited onto Ni-NTA resin from Super Flow (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Next, non-speciﬁcally bound proteins were removed using the chromatography column using a ‘Lysis’ buffer with 75 mM imidazole. More tightly bound proteins were eluted by a ‘gradient solution’ containing 75–250 mM imidazole. The fractions containing puriﬁed rSpike glycoprotein were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM of KCl and 140 mM of NaCl. Then, the solution was diluted down to 1.0 mg/mL, ﬁltered, and separated into small samples that were stored in a frozen state before use in the experiments. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was applied for the determination of rSpike protein purity, which was ~90%. Anti-rSpike protein was produced by BALB/c mice. Female mice were subcutaneously immunised four times (at intervals of 28 days) with 50 µg of rSpike protein. The antigen was emulsiﬁed by complete Freund’s adjuvant during the ﬁrst injection and/or incomplete adjuvant during the second injection, respectively. The third and fourth immunisations were performed via antigen diluted in PBS. The mouse was sacriﬁced by applying cervical dislocation four days after the ﬁnal immunisation. Then, whole blood samples were collected from the chest cavity. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 4 of 10 The collected blood was centrifuged at 300× g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was diluted by saturated ammonium sulfate solution at a ratio of 1:1. This solution containing polyclonal antibodies was incubated at 4 ◦C for 16 h. The fraction of immunoglobulin G was separated by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min. The collected precipitate was re-dissolved in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, and the solution was then mixed with a similar volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution. In this solution, total protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. Mice used for the immunisation experiments were obtained from the breeding colony of Life Sciences Center of Vilnius University (Vilnius, Lithuania). Animal maintenance and experimental protocols were performed in accordance with FELASA guidelines and Lithuanian and European legislation. Permission No. G2-117 for the generation of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies was issued by the State Food and Veterinary Service, Vilnius, Lithuania. 2.3. Preparation of Gold Electrode Surface The geometrical area of the chemically pure (99.9%) square gold (Au) electrode was 1 cm2. The surface of the Au electrode was mechanically polished using an alumina suspension. After polishing, the Au surface was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath (EMAG Emmi-40 HC) with water for 10 min. Subsequently, the electrode was kept in 0.5 M NaBH4 solution for 10 min (H2O/MeOH, v/v, 1:1) [40]. The working Au electrode was reused after each experiment, going through the same steps described in this manuscript. 2.4. The Activation of 11-MUA Based SAM and Covalent Immobilisation of the rSpike Protein To achieve this goal, the Au electrode was incubated in 1 mM 11-MUA solution in MeOH at 24 ◦C for 18 h (Figure 1, step 1). Following incubation, the electrode was rinsed with MeOH to remove the remaining 11-MUA and dried with N2. SAM, which was formed on the Au electrode surface (Au/SAM) and activated by the EDC-NHS mixture. The reaction of 11-MUA carboxyl groups with a mixture of 0.04 M EDC and 0.01 M NHS in water resulted in functionally active NHS-esters (Figure 1, step 2). The activation procedure was performed in the dark for 20 min. After activating the carboxyl functional groups, the electrode was incubated in 1 mL of 50 g/mL rSpike in PBS solution for 45 min at room temperature. rSpike was covalently attached through primary amine functional groups (Figure 1, step 3). The remains of the active esters were deactivated with 1 mM EA solution, pH 8.5 for 10 min (Figure 1, step 4). Then, 1 mL of 50 µg/mL anti-rSpike solution was added and the afﬁnity interaction of antibodies speciﬁc to rSpike was performed at room temperature for 1 h. After the incubation, the formed Au/SAM/rSpike/anti-rSpike struc- ture was washed with PBS solution and utilised for further electrochemical measurements. The formed Au/SAM, Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAM/rSpike electrodes were used in all subsequent electrochemical experiments. Au/SAM/rSpike electrodes were used for the detection of antibodies speciﬁc towards rSpike. Figure 1.

Electrochemical Measurements The bare Au electrode, Au/SAM, Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAM/rSpike elec- trodes were electrochemically characterised using the potentiostat/galvanostat AUTOLAB TYPE III (Metrohm, Netherlands) operated by FRA2-EIS ECO-Chemie software (Utrecht, Netherlands). Experiments before and after incubation stages were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, with 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−to eliminate the impact of the electrolyte composition. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 5 of 10 The experiments were carried out in the three-electrode electrochemical cell, which included the Au-based electrode (Au, Au/SAM, Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAM/rSpike) work- ing electrode, platinum (Pt) counter electrode, and as a reference electrode, Ag/AgCl in 3M KCl (Ag/AgCl(3M KCl)) microelectrode (IS-AG/AGCL.AQ.RE) (ItalSens, Netherland) was used. CV and EIS techniques were used to characterise the electrochemical properties of bare Au, Au/SAM, Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAM/rSpike electrodes at diverse steps of modiﬁcation. At a scan rate of 50 mV/s, CV measurements were carried out in the potential window of 0 to + 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl(3M KCl). A perturbation amplitude of 10 mV was used to register the EIS in the frequency range between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz. 3. Results and Discussion Electrochemical Characterisation CV and EIS measurements were used to characterise the Au electrode before and after 11-MUA SAM formation. Using a [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−couple as a redox probe and analysing the oxidation/reduction peaks of the resulting cyclic voltammogram, the inﬂuence of each stage of the surface modiﬁcation of the working electrode on conductivity was investigated. Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the Au electrode before and after the formation of the 11-MUA monolayer. On the electrode surface, long-chain thiols (n = 10) create a very stable and well-organised monolayer, which thus acts as an ionic insulator on a gold electrode. SAM has a lower defect rate and a higher fraction coverage rate [41]. As a result, additional 11-MUA molecules can obstruct the electron transfer pathway, considerably suppressing the current response (Figure 2b). Figure 2. (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the bare Au electrode (dashed line) and Au/SAM electrode after the formation of 11-MUA SAM (solid line). (b) Scaled cyclic voltammogram of the Au/SAM electrode. Measurements were performed in PBS while adding 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. Potential scans range from 0 to +0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl(3M KCl) at 50 mV/s. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 6 of 10 EIS was utilized to monitor impedimetric qualities based on the applied equivalent circuit, allowing chemical transformations and processes occurring on the conducting electrode surface to be perceived [42]. Figure 3a shows the impedance responses of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−based redox probe in PBS on the Au electrode after the formation of the Au/SAM structure based on 11-MUA (Figure 3a-1), activation of SAM with EDC and NHS (Figure 3a-2), covalent immobilization of rSpike (Figure 3a-3), and afﬁnity interaction with anti-rSpike (Figure 3a-4) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Figure 3. (a) Bode plots of differently modiﬁed Au electrode: (1) Au/SAM, (2) Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, (3) Au/SAM/rSpike, (4) Au/SAM/rSpike/anti-rSpike. The Randles equivalent circuit was applied for the analysis of EIS data, where Rs represents the dynamic solution resistance, Cdl is the double layer capacitance measured between the Au electrode and the electrolyte solution, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance of the immobilised recognition layer. (b) Nyquist plots of differently modiﬁed electrodes: Au electrodes: (1′) Au/SAM, (2′) Au/SAM/EDC-NHS, (3′) Au/SAM/rSpike, (4′) Au/SAM/rSpike/anti-rSpike. EIS measurements were performed in the PBS, pH 7.4, in presence of 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−and 0.1 M KCl at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl(3M KCl). No signiﬁcant difference between spectra 1, 2, 3, and 4 is observed (Figure 3a) at frequencies greater than 100 Hz, suggesting that the formation of SAM based on 11-MUA, the immobilisation of rSpike, and the formation of an immunocomplex between rSpike and anti-rSpike (rSpike/anti-rSpike) on the electrode surface did not have any signiﬁcant im- pact on the Rs value. On the contrary, Cdl and Rct are bound to the dielectric and insulating Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6768 7 of 10 properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface; therefore, they are signiﬁcantly affected by the changes of the Au-electrode surface. When the frequency of the EIS perturbation decreases, an imaginary component Zim = 1/jCdl becomes important and signiﬁcantly contributes to the Cdl value of the equivalent circuit [43]. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) has greater impedance at lower frequencies; as a result of this effect, the current mainly passes through Rct and Rs. The impedance value of 10.6 kΩ·cm2 at a given frequency (0.1 Hz) increased with the formation of the thiol monolayer (Figure 3a-1), the immobilisa- tion of the rSpike (12.6 kΩ·cm2) (Figure 3a-3), and the formation of the rSpike/anti-rSpike immunocomplex (14.5 kΩ·cm2) (Figure 3a-4) on the surface of the Au electrode, compared to NHS and EDS, the activated Au/SAM/EDC-NHS electrode (6.2 kΩ·cm2) (Figure 3a-2). It was observed that the Rct of the Au electrode after the formation of the SAM layer increased and had very low electron transfer efﬁciency. However, the Rct of the NHS and EDS activated Au/SAM/EDC-NHS electrode considerably decreased compared to that de- termined before the activation process. The EDC-NHS response involving the development of an intermediate electrochemically active ester was the result of the terminal–COOH interaction with EDS and NHS. The rise in Rct following rSpike and anti-rSpike binding is due to the fact that most proteins have poor electrical conductivity at low frequencies, preventing charge transfer at the electrode-solution interface. These EIS-based data ﬁt well with data presented in our previous investigations, which were based on the evaluation of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and speciﬁc antibodies against these proteins by Total Internal Reﬂection Ellipsometry, which clearly illustrate that at the interfacial electrode–solution boundary, a signiﬁcant increase in protein layer thickness and changes of dielectric properties have been observed [6,44]. Despite the fact that it provides the same information as Bode graphs, Nyquist co- ordinates are ideally suited to depict the electrochemical impedance, especially in the ‘semi-circular area’ of EIS spectra (Figure 3b). As seen in the Figure 3b, the diameter of the semi-circle rises following the formation of SAM based on 11-MUA 4.58 ± 0.22 kΩcm2 (Figure 3b-1’), activation of 11-MUA carboxyl groups by EDC and NHS 2.38 ± 0.17 kΩcm2 (Figure 3b-2’). Progressive immobilisation of rSpike protein 5.45 ± 0.32 kΩcm2 (Figure 3b-3’) and afﬁnity with anti-rSpike 6.41 ± 0.36 kΩcm2 (Figure 3b-4’) cause the interphase be- tween the Au electrode and solution to become more insulating, obstructing the passage of charged [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−ions and electron exchange between them. As a result, the electron transfer resistance Rct increased as the Au surface was changed step by step, as shown in Figure 3a. The Rct component of different modiﬁed electrodes tends to exhibit visible ﬂuctuations, which provide the high sensitivity necessary for the EIS-based approach to detect antigen-antibody complex formation. 4. Conclusions The covalent immobilisation of rSpike and afﬁnity interaction with anti-rSpike were investigated in this work. Cyclic voltammograms revealed that 11-MUA SAM molecules bound and blocked the surface of the Au electrode required for further electron transfer. EIS showed that the charge transfer resistance of the Au/SAM electrode after activation with EDC and NHS decreased when compared with the electrode before activation. The EIS spectra in Nyquist coordinates show distinct changes in each phase of Au electrode modiﬁcation: the semicircle grows after rSpike immobilisation and the antigen-antibody complex forms after anti-rSpike interaction. This enables the use of impedimetric techniques to detect the antigen-antibody complexes and, as a result, the creation of an immunosensor for the serologic diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or the assessment of vaccination success against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

For this purpose, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SCoV2-rS) was covalently immobilised on the surface of the gold electrode pre-modiﬁed with mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAMmix) consisting of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and 6-mercapto-1- hexanol. The afﬁnity interaction of SCoV2-rS with speciﬁc antibodies against this protein (anti-rS) was detected using two electrochemical methods: cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The anti-rS was detected with a detection limit of 2.53 nM and 1.99 nM using CV and EIS methods, respectively. The developed electrochemical immunosensor is suitable for the conﬁrmation of COVID-19 infection or immune response in humans after vaccination. © 2022 The Author(s).

This paper is part of the JES Focus Issue on Biosensors and Nanoscale Measurements: In Honor of Nongjian Tao and Stuart Lindsay. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is still continuously spreading worldwide. Therefore, the need for rapid and accurate detection methods, including immunosensors, remains relevant to maintain the spread of this infectious disease.1 The application of immunosensors2,3 and other afﬁnity sensors1,4 are of great interest in various clinical diagnostics due to their sensitivity, selectivity, and reliable cost. Antigens, which are recognised by the immune system, and antibodies expressed as the immune system response to the antigen can act as a biorecognition layer or target element in immunosensors suitable for the diagnosis of viral infections.5,6 SARS-CoV-2 contains a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with a length of approximately 29903 nucleotides7. The virus has crown-like spikes on the outer surface with a diameter of nearly 130 nm.8 The genome size is 29.8–29.9 kb and its one-third consists of genes that encode structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.9 The E-protein is the smallest one, and it plays a role in the formation and maturation of the virus. The M-protein can connect with other structural proteins, and its function is to keep the shape of the virus shell.10 The N-protein is the main structural element of the virion and it participates in viral replication and immune adjustment, it is an inherent attribute in the life cycle of the virus.11 The S-protein is a homotrimer protein that protrudes from the lipid bilayer surrounding SARS-CoV-212,13 and consists of two subunits, namely, S1 and S2. S1 is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, while S2 mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. The S-protein binds to the host cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors.14–18 The S-protein can serve as a biorecognition element of the immunosensor. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an immune response and the release of speciﬁc antibodies,19 which might be used as a target for immunosensors. Currently, serologic tests for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins are mainly based on common approaches such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)20 and the lateral ﬂow immunoassay (LFIA).21 Nonetheless, some widely used immunoanalytical methods possess several disadvantages, namely, they are time-consuming (ELISA) and/or not fully automated (LFIA). Therefore, it is necessary to develop rapid, non-laborious, and precise tests with the potential for quantitative analysis. Wherein various physical methods can be used for the determination of analytical signals generated by afﬁnity sensors, including surface plasmon resonance,22 scanning electro- chemical microscopy,23 electrochemical methods,24 quartz crystal microbalance,25 total internal reﬂection ellipsometry,26 etc. Among all these analytical methods, electrochemical immunosensors are characterised by some advantages such as low cost, robustness, and simplicity of detection procedure and data interpretation.24,27 Only several recent studies are dedicated to the electrochemical technique-based diagnosis of COVID-19.28–30 Speciﬁcally, electro- chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)5,31,32 and cyclic voltam- metry (CV)33 are appropriate analytical methods. The EIS is a reliable method for examining the interfacial features of events occurring on transformed surfaces. The small amplitude perturbation from the steady-state is one of the beneﬁts of EIS, which makes it a non-destructive technique.34 CV is used to acquire data concerning the redox potential and other electrochemical characteristics of analyte solutions. However, CV is also commonly used for obser- ving the processes occurring on the surface of the sensing electrode itself.35 In particular, this method is a helpful tool to assess blockage of the coated electrode surface.36 Immobilisation of the biorecognition element on the conductive surfaces of the electrode is a challenging task during the develop- ment of electrochemical afﬁnity sensors.37 One of the approaches employed for the immobilisation of biomolecules on the surface is the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique. Alkanethiol-based monolayers are considered as well-organised and stable interfaces with the necessary thickness and function.38 Therefore, the applica- tion of SAM mixture (SAMmix) consisting of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (6-MCOH) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) was used to offer an accurate approach for surface modiﬁcation with desired functional groups and covalent biomolecules immobilisation. Additionally, it minimizes the adsorption of nonspeciﬁc proteins on the surface of the working electrode.39 The objectives of this study were (i) to explore the possibility to develop an immunosensor for the serologic diagnosis of COVID-19 zE-mail: Arunas.Ramanavicius@chf.vu.lt =These authors contributed equally to this work.

Experimental Chemicals and other materials.—Microscope slides were ob- tained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (USA), 2-propanol (2-PrOH), (⩾99.5%, CAS# 67–63–0), H2SO4 (96%, CAS# 7664–93–9), 11- mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) (98%, CAS# 71310–21–9), 6- mercapto-1-hexanol (6-MCOH) (97%, CAS# 1633–78–9), ethanol (EtOH) (99.9%, CAS# 64–17–5), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’- ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (⩾99.0%, CAS# 25952– 53–8), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (>98.0%, CAS# 90604–29–8), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) tablets (pH 7.4) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (98.0%, CAS# 6066–82–6) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany). SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein (SCoV2-rS) was developed by Baltymas (Vilnius, Lithuania). K3Fe(CN)6 (⩾99.0%, CAS# 13746–66–2), K4Fe(CN)6 (⩾99.0%, CAS# 14459–95–1) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionised water. All chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade and were used as received from the producers unless otherwise stated. All electro- chemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M PBS solution adding 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 solution ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−). Preparation and/or puriﬁcation of the SCoV2-rS protein.—The SCoV2-rS protein was generated as a secreted trimeric protein in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To match a native conformation locked in a prefusion state, the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (SCoV2-S) ectodomain including amino acids (aa) 1–1208, (UniProtKB sequence accession number: P0DTC2 (SPIKE_SARS2)) was chemically synthesised at General Biosystems (USA). The synthesised gene then was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (Creative Biogene, cat. no. VET1375) via NotI and XhoI restriction sites that were introduced on 5″ and 3″ gene ends, respectively. The whole expression construct included: full-length SCoV2-S ectodomain (aa 1–1208) w/o transmembrane and cytoplasmic aa, furin cleavage site “RRAR” mutated to “GSAS,” C-terminal GSN4 trimerization motif fused to protein sequence, then follows the thrombin cleavage site, Strep-tag II and His6-tag. Two mutations (K986P and V987P) were intro- duced into the SCoV2-S sequence as well, to stabilize the trimer in the pre-fusion conformation.18 SCoV2-rS was produced in CHO cells using ExpiCHO Expression System (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, cat. no. A29133). For expression, the transfection procedures and expression conditions were applied as described in the Max Titer Protocol provided by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. Following the 9th- day post-transfection, the cultivation media was harvested and centrifuged at 5000× g for 30 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Then the supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter. After microﬁltration, proteins were concentrated and transferred to the binding buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) through tangential ultraﬁltration using tangential ﬂow ﬁltration cassette with 100 kDa cut-off membranes (SartoriusStedim Biotech, cat. no. VF20P). The protein solution was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid modiﬁed SuperFlow (Qiagen, USA) resin. Non-speciﬁcally bound proteins were removed by washing the column with a Lysis buffer containing 75 mM imidazole. Tightly bound proteins were eluted using 75 mM–250 mM imidazole gradient. Fractions containing puriﬁed SCoV2-S were pooled and dialysed against PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4), adjusted to 1.0 mg ml−1 concentration, ﬁlter-sterilised, aliquoted, and frozen for storage. The purity of produced SCoV2-rS was ∼90%, as determined by sodium dodecyl- sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Serum sample collection.—A volunteer vaccinated with a single dose of the Vaxzevria (previously known as the AstraZeneca) vaccine and who after two weeks had COVID-19 was selected for the analysis. Blood was collected one month after the volunteer was positive, which was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 was diagnosed. Whole blood was collected in a vacuette tube containing 3.5 ml of CAT serum sep clot activator (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Austria) in the laboratory of Tavo Klinika, LtD. (Vilnius, Lithuania). The serum was obtained after centrifugation at 5000× g for 15 min. The stock amount of binding antibodies vs SCoV2-S in the serum sample (4666 BAU ml-1) was deﬁned using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. The antibody concentration in the sample was converted from BAU ml-1 units to nM concentration by using the ratio as 1 BAU ml-1: 20 ng ml−1 (the molecular weight of immunoglobulin G ∼150 kDa).40–42 Serum sample was stored at −20 °C until analysis. The sample was collected in accordance with Figure 1.

Preparation of the gold electrode surface.—Microscope slides 20 × 30 mm were cleaned with 2-PrOH, ultrasonicated (ultrasonic bath Emmi-40 HC, EMAG, Germany) ﬁrstly with 2-PrOH, then with water and immersed in H2SO4 for 30 min. The slides were dried with a stream of nitrogen (N2) gas (99.99%) and placed in a vacuum magnetron, VST services Ltd. (Israel), chamber. Film depositions begin only when a vacuum of 7 × 10−8 Torr and deeper was reached. The plates were ﬁrst coated with a thin (10 nm) layer of titanium (Ti) to improve the adhesion of gold (Au) to the surface of the glass and then coated with a (100 nm) layer of Au. The activation of the SAMmix layer and covalent immobilisa- tion of the SCoV2-rS protein.—The glass slides coated with 100 nm thick Au ﬁlm were incubated at 24 °C for 4 h in 1 mM 6-MCOH and 11-MUA ethanolic solution, containing the materials in a molar ratio of 9:1, respectively, to form SAMmix (Fig. 1, step 1). After incubation, the electrode was rinsed with EtOH to remove the excess of SAMmix and then dried with N2 ﬂow. SAMmix formed on the Au electrode (Au/SAMmix) was activated by EDC-NHS mixture. During this procedure, functionally active NHS-esters were obtained by the reaction of 11-MUA carboxyl groups with a mixture of 0.004 M EDC and 0.001 M NHS in PBS (Fig. 1, step 2). The activation step was carried out for 15 min in the dark (Au/ SAMmix/EDC-NHS). After activation of carboxyl functional groups, the electrode was exposed to 70 μl of 100 μg ml−1 SCoV2-rS in PBS at room temperature for 30 min (Au/SAMmix/ EDC-NHS/SCoV2-rS). Protein SCoV2-rS was coupled covalently via primary amine functional groups (Fig. 1, step 3). The remaining reactive esters were deactivated with 0.5% BSA, 30 min (Fig. 1, step 4). Then 100 μl of anti-rS in PBS was added in a concentration range Figure 2.

Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2022 169 037523 from 30 to 150 nM and the afﬁnity interaction of speciﬁc antibodies with SCoV2-rS immobilised on the electrode was carried out at room temperature for 45 min (Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS/SCoV2-rS/ anti-rS). After each step of incubation, the structure was rinsed with PBS solution and used further for the electrochemical measure- ments. The formed Au/SAMmix, Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS, and Au/ SAMmix/SCoV2-rS electrodes were used in all further electroche- mical experiments. The Au/SAMmix/SCoV2-rS electrodes were used for the determination of speciﬁc antibodies against the SCoV2-rS protein (Fig. 1, step 5). Electrochemical measurements.—Electrochemical characterisa- tion of the Au, Au/SAMmix, Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS, and Au/ SAMmix/SCoV2-rS electrodes was performed using the potentiostat μAUTOLAB TYPE III (Metrohm, Netherland) controlled by FRA2- EIS software from ECO-Chemie (Utrecht, Netherlands). All experi- ments were performed in the three-electrode electrochemical cell. To bring the experiment closer to in vivo conditions, all experiments prior and after all incubation steps were performed in PBS, pH 7.4 with the addition of 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4- as a redox probe. The three-electrode system consisted of the Au-based electrode (Au, Au/ SAMmix, Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAMmix/SCoV2-rS) as the working electrode, platinum (Pt) wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl (Ag/AgCl(KClsat)) microelectrode (IS- AG/AGCL.AQ.RE) as the reference electrode (ItalSens, The Netherlands). Electrochemical characterisation of bare Au, Au/ SAMmix, Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAMmix/SCoV2-rS electrodes at different modiﬁcation steps were performed using CV and EIS methods. CV measurements were performed in the potential range from −0.2 to +0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl(KClsat), at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. For the registration of EIS spectra in the frequency range between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz, a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV and potential 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl(KClsat) were applied. Results and Discussion Electrochemical characterisation of a modiﬁed Au surface.— Characterisation of Au, Au/SAMmix, Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS, and Au/SAMmix/SCoV2-rS electrode has been carried out by CV and EIS methods. The impact of each step of the modiﬁcation of the working electrode surface on the conductivity has been analysed using a [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−couple as a redox probe while analysing the oxidation/reduction peaks of the corresponding cyclic voltammo- gram (Fig. 2a). The 11-MUA forms a stable and compact ﬁlm, in which the content of pinholes and structural defects in the monolayer is reduced, thereby enabling to observe mediated electron passage kinetics43. However, in order to facilitate access of the redox mediator to the electrode surface SAMmix consisting of 6-MCOH and 11-MUA was used44. The Au electrode shows a typical cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 2a-1), reversible reaction, characteristic of the redox couple, producing a current density peak of 712.4 ± 5.9 μA cm−2. After modiﬁcation of the Au electrode with the SAMmix (Fig. 2a-2), the peak decreased to 504.6 ± 19.3 μA cm−2. The EDC- NHS activation (Fig. 2a-3) of the terminal –COOH groups slightly increased the current density to 513.1 ± 6.6 μA cm−2, nevertheless, the immobilisation of SCoV2-rS (Fig. 2a-4) decreased it to 459.6 ± 9.3 μA cm−2. EIS has been used as an efﬁcient method for the monitoring of impedimetric characteristics and theoretical analysis of impedance properties based on the applied equivalent circuit, enabling the perception of chemical transformation and processes associated with the surface of the conductive electrode45. Figure 2b) shows the Table I. Analytical parameters were obtained from CV and EIS. Error bars are calculated as a percentage standard error.

EIS measurements were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, while adding 2 mM of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, signal normalised to the area of the electrode, A = 0.179 cm2. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2022 169 037523 impedance responses of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−based redox probe in PBS on the Au electrode (Fig. 2b-1), after the formation of the Au/ SAMmix structure based on 11-MUA and 6-MCOH, molar ratio 1:9, respectively (Fig. 2b-2), activation of SAMmix with EDC and NHS (Fig. 2b-3), the covalent immobilisation of SCoV2-rS (Fig. 2b-4) in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The Nyquist coordinates are well suited to represent the electro- chemical impedance, especially at the “semi-circular part” of the EIS spectra represented in Fig. 2b). It is shown that after the formation of SAMmix on the Au electrode, the diameter of the semicircle increases. Therefore, when the Au surface was modiﬁed, the electron transfer resistance Rct has also increased from 141 ± 34 Ω·cm2 to 884 ± 163 Ω·cm2. Then, the activation of the terminal-COOH groups with EDC-NHS forming an intermediate active ester was performed and is led to the decrease of Au/SAMmix/EDC-NHS semicircle as well Rct value down to 300 ± 46 Ω·cm2.46 This intermediate product displayed tremendous electrochemical behaviour, the increase in Rct up to 1280 ± 237 Ω·cm2 after SCoV2-rS binding can be explained by the fact that, at low frequencies, most biological molecules, including proteins, have poor electrical conductivity and therefore impede charge transfer at the interphase between the electrode and solution. For differently modiﬁed electrodes, the Rct component tends to have apparent variations, which are providing the high sensitivity required for the detection of antigen-antibody complex formation by the EIS-based technique. Subsequently, after the immobilisation of SCoV2-rS, the deactivation of the remaining activated carboxyl groups and the blocking of the free surface to avoid non-speciﬁc binding are performed using 0.5% solution of BSA. Electrochemical sensing of anti-rS.—The afﬁnity interaction of anti-rS with immobilised SCoV2-rS was performed by sequentially incubating the working surface with 30 nM of anti-rS PBS solution (the concentration range 30 nM–150 nM). CV and EIS measure- ments are performed in the presence of 2 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−in a PBS solution applying the parameters described in the previous part. The concentration range is obtained by successive dilutions of the stock solution. The afﬁnity interaction of anti-rS with immobilised SCoV2-rS and immune complex formation (Fig. 3a-1) continues to insulate the working electrode surface thereby reducing Fe[(CN)6]3−/4−ﬂow towards the electrode. Thus, the decrease in redox current is the stepwise ﬂattening of the cyclic voltammograms with increasing anti-rS concentration (Fig. 3a). Partial coating of the electrode surface with the increasing concentrations of anti-rS causes a corresponding decrease of anodic (jpa) and cathodic (jpc) current density at the range of potentials from 460 mV to 600 mV and from −130 mV to −200 mV, respectively (Table I). The potential shift with increasing concentration of anti-rS can be explained due to hindered electron exchange at the Au electrode surface as a result of biomolecules binding, thereby, affecting the value of the redox reaction potential. Noteworthy, that for lower concentrations Figure 5. Calibration curves obtained from CV (a) and EIS spectra ﬁtted Rct (b) and EIS maximum of Z″(c). Error bars are calculated as a percentage standard error. Signal normalised to the electrode area, A = 0.179 cm2. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2022 169 037523 (0−90 nM) of anti-rS, the values of maximum current densities decrease faster, while for higher concentrations (90 −150 nM) the process reaches saturation point (Figs. 4 and 5). The same effect is accompanied by a sequential growth of the semicircle radius in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 3b). EIS reveals the broad trend for radii growth toward lower concentrations (0 −90 nM) and a slowdown in the radii growth at high concentrations (90–150 nM). The number of non-occupied SCoV2-rS decrease with the increase of antibody concentration and obtained signal values from CV and EIS are summarised in Table I, where the dependence of the increased Rct value vs concentration tends to plateau at high content of anti-rS. Analytical characterisation of the immunosensor developed for the anti-rS detection.—To evaluate the analytical characteristics of the electrochemical immunosensor, limits of detection (LODs) for sensing anti-rS were calculated from CV and EIS measurements. From CV, the highest value of the anodic current density (jpa) and the lowest value of cathodic current density (jpc) was used as the signal. From EIS, as a signal, the Rct value (obtained as a maximum value of Z′) and maximum of Z″ were used. The values of data in Table I, were normalised using the equation: = ( − ( ))/( ( ) − ( )) × zi xi x x x min max min 100, where zi - the value of Normalised%, xi - extracted electrochemical parameter (jpa, Z′max, Z″max) at each concentration of anti-rS; min(x) —the minimum value in the list of each extracted electrochemical parameter; max(x)—the maximum value of each extracted electro- chemical parameter. Obtained values of the normalised signal (Normalised%) vs the concentration of anti-rS were plotted and shown in the Figs. 5 and 6. The Langmuir ﬁt was obtained by ﬁtting the Normalised signal (as y-value) and concentration data (as x-value) to equation: = × /( + ) y B x K x , d max where Bmax—maximum value obtained during speciﬁc binding and Kd- equilibrium dissociation constant, a concentration needed to achieve a half-maximum binding at equilibrium. Kd values of 37 nM and 39 nM were obtained from parameters extracted in CV data. Similar values (19–33 nM) were reported in a previous work, where C-reactive protein was investigated.47 The equation: σ = / LOD slope , where σ is the standard deviation of the y-intercept of the standard plot ((Normalised%) vs target concentration) was used for LODs calculation.48 As a result, immunosensor for anti-rS detection by the CV using jpa, is characterised by LOD of 2.53 nM and it was deﬁned from the standard plot shown in Fig. 6a. For comparison, the LOD obtained from CV in the cathodic area was twice higher, giving the value of 5.85 nM, which could be explained by slower electron charge transfer in the cathodic region. LODs for EIS based method (Figs. 6b Figure 6. Calibration curves obtained from CV (a) and EIS ﬁtted Rct (b), EIS, maximum of Z″ (c). Error bars are calculated as a percentage standard error. Signal normalised to electrode area, A = 0.179 cm2. Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 2022 169 037523 and 6c) were calculated and compared for several methodologies of data analysis. When a plot of Normalised% calculated using the Rct value vs concentration was used, the LOD with a value of 2.78 nM was obtained. For comparison, the LOD value obtained from the maximum of the Z″ peak was 1.99 nM, which is 38% lower. Conclusions In this study, the covalent immobilisation of SCoV2-rS and its afﬁnity interaction with anti-rS were evaluated. The surface of the Au electrode was characterised by CV and EIS methods after each modiﬁcation step. CVs revealed that the peak current density measured with the addition of 2 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−decreased after the formation of the SAMmix on the electrode surface. EIS spectra represented in Nyquist coordinates indicate evident changes in every step of Au electrode modiﬁcation. The charge transfer resistance of the Au/ SAMmix electrode after activation with EDC and NHS decreased compared to the electrode before activation, while the semicircle increases after immobilisation of SCoV2-rS and afﬁnity interaction with anti-rS. The anti-rS antibodies were quantiﬁed using CV and EIS methods, giving the lowest LOD values of 2.53 nM and 1.99 nM, respectively. This allows the application of impedimetric methods to detect the formation of antigen-antibody complexes and the subsequent development of an immunosensor for the serologic diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or the determination of the success of vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Introduction Vascular endothelial growth factor protein (VEGF) is a key signaling  protein that is unregulated in response to hypoxic conditions and plays a  crucial role in both physiological and pathological processes, particu- larly in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. During embryogenesis, VEGF  is essential for the formation of vascular system, facilitating the differ- entiation of endothelial cells and the development of new blood vessels.  In adult organisms, the dysregulation of VEGF expression is often  associated with various diseases, including cancer, where it promotes  tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing blood supply to the tumor  microenvironment (Rodriguez et al., 2021). The ability to accurately  identify and quantify VEGF as a biomarker has significant implications  for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as it not only aids in the early  identification of tumors but also serves as a critical indicator of treat- ment efficacy and disease progression (Kwon et al., 2021). Therefore,  the development of robust and sensitive detection methods for VEGF is  essential for advancing personalised medicine and improving clinical  outcomes in oncology. The VEGF protein family in mammals comprises five distinct mem- bers: VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D (Goel and Mercurio, 2013),  and placenta growth factor (PLGF) (Simons et al., 2016). VEGF-A is the  most researched component and is often referred to simply as VEGF. It  plays a central role in angiogenesis, especially in tumor growth and  metastasis (Guyot and Pag`es, 2015). VEGF-B is primarily involved in the  maintaining blood vessels but does not significantly induce angiogenesis  (Angelescu et al., 2013). VEGF-C and VEGF-D are key regulators of  lymphangiogenesis (the formation of lymphatic vessels) and are  involved in cancer metastasis to lymph nodes (Zhang et al., 2022). The  most common isoform of VEGF is VEGF165, which refers to the isoform of  VEGF-A containing 165 amino acids. This isoform is associated with the  growth and metastasis of numerous forms of human malignancies  (Ferrara et al., 2003). Additionally, human disorders, such as malig- nancies (Xie et al., 2018), rheumatoid arthritis (Di Stasi et al., 2023),  psoriasis (Mao et al., 2023), and Alzheimer’s disease (Shamsipour et al.,  2021), have been linked to VEGF by blood biomarker analysis. Due to its  numerous physiological and pathological functions, VEGF has attracted  interest as a biomarker for analytical sensing platforms for sensing and  detection. Biosensors are generally classified according to the type of trans- ducer or bioreceptor employed in their design, providing insights into  their functionality and applications (Lu et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023).  Bioreceptors are essential components of biosensors, as they are  responsible for ensuring the specificity and sensitivity of detection  methods (Qiu et al., 2019a), natural and synthetic antibodies (Yu et al.,  2023a), and enzymes (Yu et al., 2023b), each offering distinct advan- tages for various applications. For instance, a study demonstrated the  use of aptamers in a dual-channel photoelectrochemical ratiometric  aptasensor that utilises up-converting nanocrystals in a custom-made  3D-printed device (Qiu et al., 2019b), which demonstrates the versa- tility and effectiveness of aptamers in complex detection scenarios. In  contrast, the role of antibodies is highlighted in a micro- electromechanical microsystem-supported photothermal immunoassay  designed for point-of-care testing of aflatoxin B1 in food products,  showcasing the potential of antibodies in food safety applications (Yu  et al., 2023a). Lastly, the use of enzymes is demonstrated through  enzyme-encapsulated  protein  trap-engineered  metal-organic  framework-derived biomineral probes for non-invasive prostate cancer  monitoring, highlighting the effectiveness of enzymatic activity in  improving detection capabilities (Yu et al., 2023b). These works  collectively highlight the diverse functions of aptamers, antibodies, and  enzymes as bio-receptors in advancing biosensing technologies across  various fields. While antibodies have historically served as effective bio-  receptors, they have limitations such as high cost, complex purification  procedures, and batch-to-batch variations (Crivianu-Gaita and Thomp- son, 2016). Aptamers have emerged as promising alternatives due to  their DNA or RNA-based structure, which allows them to bind to specific  target molecules. Two notable examples that exemplify innovative  biosensing approaches are the cation exchange reaction-mediated pho- tothermal and polarity-switchable photoelectrochemical dual-readout  biosensor (Lu et al., 2023) and the photocurrent-polarity-switching  photoelectrochemical biosensor for switching spatial distance electro- active tags (Zeng et al., 2023). The former utilises a cation exchange  reaction to mediate photothermal effects while employing a dual-  readout mechanism, enhancing sensitivity and specificity for various  applications. Conversely, the latter biosensor leverages photocurrent  polarity-switching techniques to detect electroactive tags based on their  spatial distance, allowing for improved selectivity and control in sensing  applications (Zeng et al., 2023). These examples illustrate the diversity  within the biosensor field and the ongoing advancements in transducer  technologies and bioreceptor designs, highlighting the potential for  more sensitive and selective detection methods across various biomed- ical applications. Cai et al. study developed a competitive-displacement  reaction strategy for sensitive photoelectrochemical aptasensing of  prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using target-induced dissociation of gold  nanoparticle-coated graphene nanosheets from CdS quantum dot-  functionalized mesoporous titanium dioxide (Cai et al., 2018). Xu  et al. study presents an ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical aptasensor  for detecting 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) using hemin/G-  quadruplex photocurrent polarity switching on ultrathin ZnIn2S4  nanosheets, achieving a detection limit of 0.3 pM while demonstrating  high sensitivity, stability, selectivity, and accuracy in complex biological  matrices (Xu et al., 2022). Aptamers, selected through the systematic  evolution of ligands by the exponential enrichment (SELEX) method,  exhibit high affinity and selectivity, binding non-covalently to analytes  via various interactions (Qureshi et al., 2015). These characteristics  enable aptamers to provide several advantages over antibodies,  including higher affinity, specificity, thermal stability, and lower cost  (Nourizad et al., 2023). For example, RNA aptamers isolated using  SELEX demonstrated superior discrimination against similar molecules  such as caffeine and theobromine compared to theophylline, with  binding affinities up to 10,000 times higher (Huang and Liu, 2022).  Similarly, aptamers selected for L-arginine showed a 12,000-fold pref- erence for the target over its enantiomer (Geiger et al., 1996). Further- more, anti-VEGF RNA aptamers strongly bind to VEGF165/164,  distinguishing them from structurally similar proteins such as VEGF121  (Ruckman et al., 1998). In addition, aptamers have shown the ability to  differentiate target cells, even between highly similar cell types (Xie  et al., 2023). The sensor designed for VEGF detection employs a self-assembling  DNA aptamer as the bioreceptor, and its electrochemical detection  mechanism can be compared to the dual-readout capabilities of cation  exchange reaction-mediated biosensors. This comparison highlights the  capacity of the sensor to achieve high specificity and sensitivity through  innovative design, akin to the methodologies used in dual-readout bio- sensors. Additionally, the photocurrent-polarity-switching biosensor il- lustrates the significance of dynamic response mechanisms in  biosensing, which is relevant to the operational efficiency of the VEGF  sensor. The adaptability and precision of the self-assembling DNA  aptamer structure suggest a potential for enhanced interaction with the  target protein, similar to the use of spatial distance and electroactive  tags in other biosensors to improve detection capabilities. V. Liustrovaite et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Science of the Total Environment 955 (2024) 177151 Various methods have been proposed for the quantitative detection  of VEGF. These include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  (Hsu et al., 2016), fluorescent analysis (Al-Ameen et al., 2015), surface-  enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) (Zhao et al., 2015), enzyme-linked  chemiluminescence immunoassay (Wang et al., 2021), electrochemical  detection (Ni et al., 2020). However, many of these techniques require  intricate procedures, advanced instrumentation, and highly trained  personnel. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing  VEGF sensors with high sensitivity, simple operation, and low cost. The  pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) method is a rapid voltammetric  detection technique used in biosensors (Ratautaite et al., 2023). Its  primary advantage over other voltammetric approaches is its ability to  conduct analyses without a redox probe. This greatly simplifies the  experimental setup, streamlining the procedure and allowing measure- ments to be taken directly in the phosphate buffer solution. This capa- bility improves efficiency and makes the method more versatile and  accessible in various analytical settings. It should be noted that we  specifically chose this method for our experiments because of its speed  and suitability for biosensing applications. This work focuses on developing an electrochemical sensor based on  a self-assembling aptamer structure supported by electrochemically  polymerised polypyrrole (Ppy), specifically designed to determine  VEGF. The self-assembling aptamer structure, comprising three distinct  parts of single-stranded DNA, is immobilised onto the Ppy-modified  SPCE through a two-step process. Initially, the Ppy layer is electro- chemically deposited onto the SPCE, providing a conductive matrix that  facilitates the subsequent immobilisation of the aptamer. Following the  deposition, the self-assembled DNA aptamer structure is introduced to  the Ppy matrix, allowing for efficient entrapment and stabilisation of the  aptamer. The pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) method was then  applied to generate analytical signals in response to VEGF binding. The  interaction behaviour between VEGF in solution and the immobilised  DNA aptamer/Ppy structure was analysed using the Langmuir isotherm  model. Overall, the developed electrochemical biosensor shows signifi- cant promise for in vitro applications in early cancer diagnostics and  treatment monitoring, enabling rapid screening of patient samples. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Pyrrole 98 % (CAS# 109–97-7, Alfa Aesar, Kandel, Germany), tablets  of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, (CAS# 7647-14-5, Sigma- –Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), and sulfuric acid (96 %, CAS# 7664-93-  9, Lachner, Neratovice, Czech Republic) were used in the experiments.  Desalted unmodified and 3′- Thiol-Modifier C6 S–S DNA oligonucleo- tides and DL-dithiothreitol (DTT, CAS# 3483-12-3) were obtained from  Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. V Recombinant  human VEGF165 protein, expressed in HEK293 cells, was purchased from  Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany. All reagents were analytical grade,  and deionised water was used to prepare all aqueous solutions. 2.2. Hybridization of oligonucleotides (anti-VEGF aptamer) The underlined sequence in Table 1 denotes the previously published  anti-VEGFA SL2B aptamer sequence (Kaur and Yung, 2012). Addition- ally, other DNA sequences form a stem (stalk) structure after oligonu- cleotide hybridisation (Fig. 1A). The process involves the reduction of  the thiol-modified oligonucleotide (stalkGTG) prior to aptamer assem- bly, wherein the disulphide bond of the 3′-thiol modifier is reduced using  a standard protocol. Firstly, the thiol-modified oligonucleotide is dis- solved in 125 μL of dithiothreitol solution (100 mM DTT in 10 mM so- dium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3) and incubated at room temperature for  1 h. Subsequently, any by-product is removed through a commercial  Sephadex® G-25 column (NAP-10, ‘Cytiva’). Following reduction, the  hybridisation of oligonucleotides takes place to assemble the aptamer.  This involves determining DNA concentrations via UV spectrophotom- etry and mixing equal volumes of normalised oligonucleotide solutions  (combSL2B, stalkGTG, and r_stalkGTG) at a concentration of 30 pM/μL  in PBS buffer, followed by boiling in a water bath (a beaker containing  100–150 mL of water) for 5 min, then slowly cooled to room  temperature. 2.3. Pre-treatment of working electrodes, electrochemical modification by  a polymer layer, and electrochemical measurements The electrochemical experiments were carried out using a poten- tiostat/galvanostat AUTOLAB TYPE III from ECO-Chemie/Metrohm  (Barendrecht, The Netherlands), controlled by the FRA2-EIS software  from ECO-Chemie/Metrohm, (Utrecht, The Netherlands). The initial set  of electrodes consisted of DRP-110 screen-printed carbon electrodes  (SPCE) obtained from Metrohm/DropSens (Oviedo, Spain). These elec- trodes have a working electrode with a geometric area of 0.126 cm2, a  carbon-based counter electrode, and a reference electrode. Before the electrochemical modification with Ppy, the working  electrodes were electrochemically cleaned using cyclic voltammetry to  ensure accurate detection in an electrochemical immunoassay (Lv et al.,  2019; Zeng et al., 2022). This involved immersing the electrodes in a 0.5  M sulfuric acid solution and potential cycling for 20 cycles at a sweep  rate of 0.1 V/s in the range from �0.1 V to +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The polymer layer was deposited with a two-step electrochemical  polymerisation procedure (Fig. 1B). Two steps were taken to deposit the  Ppy-entrapped aptamer (Ppy/anti-VEGF) on the SPCE electrodes: (i) In  the first step, the Ppy under-layer was electrochemically deposited from  a polymerisation solution containing 0.1 M of pyrrole in 10 mM PBS, pH  7.4, and a sequence of 5 potential pulses (of +0.95 V for 1 s and 0 V for  30 s) was applied; (ii) In the second step, anti-VEGF was added to the  same polymerisation bulk solution, and the sequence of 5 potential  pulses (of +0.95 V for 1 s and 0 V for 30 s) was repeated. The anti-VEGF  aptamer is embedded within the polypyrrole structure, providing sup- port and stability to the aptamer molecule. Pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) was used to evaluate Ppy-  modified electrodes. The sequence consisted of 10 potential pulses of  +600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl lasting 2 s and 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl lasting 2 s. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole-based VEGF aptamer Using a series of potential pulses, polymer-based layers were elec- trochemically deposited on the surface of SPCE. The potential pulse  series profile during the application of the polypyrrole-based (Ppy) layer  to SPCE is shown in Fig. 2A. According to the experimental procedures  described in the experimental section, a polypyrrole-based VEGF  aptamer (Ppy/anti-VEGF) layer was created on SPCEs through two steps  (Fig. 2B, 2C).

Science of the Total Environment 955 (2024) 177151 In the first step, a Ppy underlayer was electrochemically deposited  from a solution of 0.1 M pyrrole in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) by applying 5  potential pulses (+0.95 V for 1 s followed by 0 V for 30 s). This thin Ppy  underlayer, similar to approaches used in other studies (Balciunas et al.,  2022; Ktari et al., 2015; Liustrovaite et al., 2023) was implemented to  enhance the adhesion and performance of the sensing layer while min- imising the direct interaction between the electrode and the target an- alyte. In particular, it mitigated the direct interaction of VEGF with the  electrode surface, ensuring a more effective formation of the Ppy/anti-  VEGF layer. In the second step, the anti-VEGF aptamer was added to  the same polymerisation solution, and the sequence of 5 potential pulses  was repeated. This process embeds the anti-VEGF aptamer within the  Ppy structure, providing enhanced stability and support for the aptamer  molecule while shielding the electrode surface. Similar to approaches  seen in MIP and self-assembled monolayer (SAM) systems. This two-step  process is crucial for optimising the sensing layer’s adhesion and func- tional performance. 3.2. Electrochemical characterisation of polypyrrole-based aptamer layer  and VEGF detection The selection of duration in the PAD method is crucial in achieving  accurate and sensitive electrochemical measurements. In this case, a  series of 10 pulses of 0 V and 10 pulses of +0.6 V are utilised, each  lasting for 2 s (Fig. 3A), as suggested in our previous research  (Ramanaviciene and Ramanavicius, 2004). The choice of +0.6 V for  detection is based on its ability to induce the desired electrochemical  reactions and provide an optimal signal response. Furthermore, it was  stated that at +0.65 V vs Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl), the unsubstituted Ppy starts  to overoxidise (Lewis et al., 1997). During the evaluation of the obtained  current changes by application potential pulses, the drop of the current  was attentively analysed at certain moments or intervals in the potential  pulses of +0.6 V and 0 V. Such moments in the potential pulse were at  0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, 0.8 s, and 2.0 s (Fig. 3B). Analysing current  changes at specific moments within the potential pulse allows the  characterisation of different electrochemical processes. Investigating  and determining different redox reactions or species exhibiting diverse  kinetics or affinities toward the electrode surface becomes possible. This  methodology facilitates gathering intricate and thorough insights into  the electrochemical system. Fig. 3A shows a graphical representation of the PAD method; the x-  axis of the graph represents time, and the y-axis represents the electrical  current. Fig. 3B depicts the pulse as two pulses, one at +0.6 V and the  other at 0 V, which were applied to the electrode. Each pulse exhibits  specific time points marked along the x-axis at 0.1 s intervals. Current  values at 0.1 s for 0.6 V and 0 V were extracted from the graph and  marked as ΔI 0.1s. Similarly, data points were collected from the graph at  time intervals of 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, and 0.8 s and were labelled as ΔI 0.2s,  ΔI 0.4s, ΔI 0.6s, and ΔI 0.8s, respectively. These time points represent  different time placements within the overall pulse duration taken for  further investigation, as described in the following (Fig. 4). 3.3.

Science of the Total Environment 955 (2024) 177151 chosen to measure VEGF over a concentration range of 0 to 24 nM.  Several specific moments in the potential pulse (Xs) were investigated,  including 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, 0.8 s, and 2.0 s. Calibration curves  (Fig. 4) were plotted using a normalised response (NR ΔI at Xs) in current  ΔI at Xs, obtained from PAD measurements performed after incubating  Ppy/anti-VEGF and Ppy in the 10 mM PBS solution, pH 7.4, containing  VEGF in the range of concentrations from 0 to 24 nM. The incubations  were carried out for 15 min at room temperature. Ppy and Ppy/anti-  VEGF electrodes were rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4, and a solution be- tween incubating electrodes in various VEGF concentrations. To  Fig. 2.

NRΔIat Xs = ΔIat Xs(0 nM VEGF) �ΔIat Xs (1)  Understanding the interactions of binding sites with aptamers and  proteins poses challenges when employing electrochemical methods.  Therefore, our investigation relies heavily on the mathematical analysis  of adsorption isotherms, primarily the Langmuir model. This involves  fitting experimental data to the Langmuir isotherm to derive model  parameters. In the study by Gonzato et al. (2021), cilostazol-extracted  MIPs embedded in a polymer film were used to measure binding pa- rameters. Experiments were performed using Freundlich, Langmuir, and  Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms. The Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm  best fitted the data, indicating highly homogeneous and relatively ho- mogeneous cavities in the polymer matrix. Next, Çalık, Balcı, and  ¨Ozdamar (Çalik et al., 2010) conducted an equilibrium binding analysis  on recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in liquid-phase and  immobilised-aptamer phase, using the Langmuir type adsorption  isotherm. Following previous research, we adapted the Langmuir  isotherm (Eq. 2) and applied it to our experiments, as shown in Fig. 4.  ΔI = ΔImax × [VEGF] K × [VEGF] (2)  Where ΔImax is the maximal normalised value of current density, K – is  the adapted Langmuir constant, and [VEGF] – is the concentration of  VEGF. K, ΔImax, and R2 values can be found in Table 2. Table 2 provides a detailed summary of K, ΔImax, and R2 values ob- tained from experiments calculated for specific moments in the potential  pulse of +0.6 V and 0 V potential pulses at 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, and  0.8 s (Fig. 4A-E), with the corresponding standard deviation errors. High  R2 values close to 1 across different specific moments in the potential  pulse indicate a strong fit of the experimental data to the adapted  Langmuir model, indicating its suitability for describing the adsorption  behaviour of VEGF on the sensing surface. Furthermore, the dependence  of the K at specific moments in the potential pulse of Ppy/anti-VEGF and  the corresponding Ppy-modified electrodes is shown in Fig. 4F. Notably,  the K values tend to increase with longer specific moments in the po- tential pulse, indicating a positive correlation between the duration of  the interaction and the affinity of VEGF for the sensing material. This  observation suggests that prolonged exposure of the sensing surface to  VEGF allows for more extensive binding interactions to occur, leading to  a higher equilibrium constant. Longer specific moments in the potential  pulse likely facilitate more significant adsorption of VEGF molecules  onto the surface, resulting in enhanced sensitivity and specificity of the  sensor. Increasing K values from 1.25 ± 0.09 nM to 2.47 ± 0.49 nM with  longer specific moments in the potential pulse underscores optimising  the experimental conditions to achieve the desired sensitivity and ac- curacy in VEGF detection. Researchers may consider adjusting the  duration of the specific moments in the potential pulse to maximise the  binding interactions between VEGF and the sensing surface while  maintaining the dynamic range and reliability of the sensor response. It  is noteworthy that K values for the Ppy layer remain relatively similar.  Consequently, the ΔImax values for the Ppy/anti-VEGF layer and the Ppy  layer are consistently lower for a longer specific moment in the potential  pulse compared to a shorter specific moment in the potential pulse. 3.3.2. Adaptation of integrated Cottrell equation The integrated Cottrell equation (Anson plot) was employed to  further analyse and discuss the results. The relation of the cumulative  charge passed and time in Ppy-based electrochemical sensors obeys the  integrated Cottrell equation (Eq. 3–4):  Q = Qf + Qd.l. + Qads. (3)  Qf = 2nFAC ̅̅̅̅ D π √ ̅̅ t √ = k√t (4)  Qads. = FnΓ (5)  where: Q – total charge (C); n – number of electrons; F – Faraday con- stant (96,485C/mol); A – area of the electrode (cm2); C – concentration  (M); D – diffusion coefficient (cm2/s); t – time (s); Qd.l. – the charge of the  electrical double layer; Qads. – charge induced by adsorbed ions. The study done by Anson et al. (Anson et al., 1967) underscored the  effectiveness of a double potential step chronocoulometric technique in  accurately quantifying adsorbed reactants, providing valuable insights  into electrochemical processes without the need for complex models. In  the integrated Cottrell equation, the total charge accumulation com- prises three components: Faradaic charges (Qf) arising from redox ac- tivity, charges from the charging and discharging of the electrode-  electrolyte double-layer capacitance (Qd.l.), and changes in charge due  to adsorbed species (Qads.). When plotting the total charge (Q) against  the square root of time (t½), a linear relationship emerges, where the plot  of Q versus t½ exhibits a linear correlation with the slope (k) and the  intercept corresponding to Qads. + Qd.l.. Notably, the study observed that  maximum adsorption typically occurs at intermediate concentrations of  specific compounds. In contrast, changes in adsorption patterns suggest  specific bonding interactions between the reactants and the electrode  surface. The previous study (Ratautaite et al., 2023) investigated the  complex effects of electrode modification on the adsorption behaviour of  analytes and reaction products. Unlike prior studies utilising plain  electrodes, the study employed Pt electrodes modified with the con- ducting polymer Ppy, which were further imprinted or non-imprinted  with glycoprotein. This modification introduced additional layers and  functionalities to the electrode surface, altering the electrochemical  behaviour of the system. The Ppy layer could participate in charging and  discharging processes during electrochemical oxidation and reduction  reactions by changing the potentials. In our study, we used the polymer-  supported aptamer layer on the electrode. These insights complicate the  analysis of amperograms, but it is still possible to describe them in the  terms proposed by Anson. Fig. 5A for Ppy/anti-VEGF and Fig. 5B for Ppy show the Anson plots  for the data from Fig. 3 amperograms. Linear regression was used to fit  the relationship between Q and t½. Table 3 lists the parameters of the  corresponding equations. The obtained R2 values indicate a linear cor- relation in the plot of Q vs. t½ (Table 3). The exponential dependence of  the slope and the intercept on the concentration of VEGF is represented  in Figs. 5C and 5D (for 0.6 V), respectively. The plots illustrate that slope  and intercept values differ for Ppy/anti-VEGF and Ppy-modified  Table 2  K, ΔImax, and R2 values were calculated for specific moments in the potential pulse of +0.6 V and 0 V potential pulses at 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, 0.8 s, and 2 s.

Science of the Total Environment 955 (2024) 177151 electrodes under the same experimental conditions. The data depicted in Fig. 5C reveal a notable decrease in the slope (k)  of the Anson equation, as calculated according to equation (Eq. 4), with  increasing concentrations of VEGF. The slope is associated with (i) the  equivalent number of electrons ‘n’ transferred during the electro- chemical reaction; (ii) the electrochemically active area (A); the con- centration of material (C); and the diffusion coefficient (D). In our  investigation, the observed dependence of slope (k) on the concentration  (C) of glycoprotein suggests a decrease in the electrochemically active  area (A). This deduction is supported by the assumption that the values  of parameters (n)’ and (D) remain constant across all evaluated con- centrations of VEGF, owing to the consistency in the concentration of  other solution components and their respective physicochemical char- acteristics (e.g., density and viscosity). Notably, the slope value de- pendency on the concentration of VEGF is more pronounced in the case  of the Ppy/anti-VEGF modified electrode compared to the Ppy-modified  electrode.) In chronocoulometric experiments, the charge increases propor- tionally with the t1/2 due to the diffusion of additional reactant to the  electrode surface. If some of the reactants become adsorbed at the  electrode/electrolyte interface while the electrode is held at a potential  of 0 V, when the potential is switched to +0.6 V, the adsorbed reactant  will be reduced almost instantly, resulting in an additional burst of  charge. However, after this initial response, the chronocoulometric  behaviour remains unaffected by the adsorption of the reactant. In this  case, plots of Q versus t1/2 will have intercepts exceeding Q by an  amount of charge equal to Qdl. Notably, the slope remains unaffected by  the presence of adsorbed reactant. The values of Qads serve as direct  measures of the quantity of adsorbed reactant by Faraday’s Law (Eq. 5),  where Γ represents the quantity of adsorbed reactant in moles. Fig. 5D  depicts intercept values of the concentration of VEGF protein (nM),  while the intercept corresponds to Qads + Qdl. To determine Qads from the  intercept of a chronocoulometric plot of Q versus t1/2, it is crucial to  ascertain or measure Qdl. This poses no challenge when the adsorption of  a reactant elicits minimal or negligible alteration in the interfacial  capacitance, allowing the value obtained in a blank experiment in the  absence of analyte (0 nM of VEGF) to apply to measurements conducted  in the presence of the adsorbing analyte (Anson and Osteryoung, 1983). 3.4. Determination of the limit of detection PAD-based electrochemical measurements were conducted to assess  the limit of detection (LOD). Intercept values, which correspond to Qads  + Qdl, were taken from Table 3. To evaluate the Qads, a blank experiment  in the absence of an analyte (0 nM of VEGF) was employed, respectively,  for Ppy and Ppy/anti-VEGF as analytical signals. VEGF protein con- centration linear calibration plotted against ΔQ (MC) is shown in Fig. 6.  The slope for the VEGF (concentration expressed in nM) registered by  the Ppy electrode was 0.001 mC/nM, with R2 = 0.96, while the linear  regression slope for the VEGF onto the Ppy/anti-VEGF modified elec- trode was 0.1 mC/nM, with R2 = 0.99. The LOD was calculated ac- cording to the equation:  LOD = 3.3 × SD slope (6)  where SD represents the standard deviation. It was evaluated that the LOD for the modified electrode Ppy/anti-  VEGF was 0.21 nM. A comparison of electrochemical methods previously used to detect  VEGF protein is shown in Table 4. Table 4 represents various approaches to VEGF detection utilising  different electrode materials, polymers, and detection techniques. The  first method employs flexible silk protein matrices combined with a  conducting ink containing PEDOT:PSS, showcasing a biocompatible  platform suitable for antibody immobilisation. This approach demon- strates a moderate LOD of 1.03 pg/mL and exhibits a wide linear range  Fig. 5.

Liustrovaite et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Science of the Total Environment 955 (2024) 177151 from 1 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL (Xu and Yadavalli, 2019). The second method  uses a gold screen-printed electrode functionalised with a MIP, syn- thesised using acrylamide and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) as a  monomer and crosslinker polymerised around EGFR and VEGF tem- plates. This technique shows a LOD of 0.005 pg/mL and a wide linear  range from 0.01 pg/mL to 7000 pg/mL (Johari-Ahar et al., 2018).  Additionally, the biosensor demonstrates the value of using multidisci- plinary approaches in protein detection. It combines MIP technology,  antibody-conjugated nanoliposomes, and electrochemical detection to  sensitively and selectively determine VEGF (Johari-Ahar et al., 2018).  The third method, which employs poly(o-phenylenediamine) as the  polymer matrix, uses a glassy carbon electrode modified with graphene  nanoribbons (GNRs) and AuNPs. Using differential pulse voltammetry  (DPV), this method yields a linear range of from 0.5 ng/mL to 500 ng/  mL and a LOD of 300 pg/mL (He et al., 2023). Notably, this study  significantly contributes to this field by introducing a novel PAD  approach that employs the SPCE coated with Ppy. Unlike previous  methods, this approach does not require the use of a redox mediator,  which simplifies the detection process. The newly developed biosensor  boasts an impressive LOD of 0.21 nM, enabling it to detect e VEGF  within the range of 1.0–20 nM. This novel technique underscores the  importance of investigating different electrode materials and detection  strategies to improve the sensitivity and specificity of VEGF detection  assays. While this study did not involve the analysis of real samples, the  accuracy of the developed aptasensing platform was rigorously evalu- ated through in vitro testing using known concentrations of VEGF pro- tein. The use of PAD, as demonstrated by Anson et al. (Anson et al.,  1967), ensured precise quantification of adsorbed reactants, allowing  for accurate differentiation between Faradaic and non-Faradaic pro- cesses. The accuracy of the sensor was further validated by determining  the LOD through PAD, yielding a highly sensitive detection limit of 0.21  nM with a strong linear correlation. These results suggest that the  platform has strong potential for future applications involving real  samples, such as clinical or environmental diagnostics. Further work  will focus on real sample testing to confirm its performance in practical  settings. 4. Conclusions This study represents a notable advancement in biosensing technol- ogy for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The developed  electrochemical aptasensor demonstrates the potential of aptamer-based  sensors for the sensitive and selective detection of disease-related pro- teins, specifically VEGF. The key achievements of this work include the  utilisation of a self-assembling DNA aptamer structure, which offers  high specificity for VEGF, and the integration of a polypyrrole (Ppy)/  anti-VEGF matrix, which enhances sensitivity, resulting in a low  detection limit of 0.21 nM. Moreover, adopting PAD without redox  mediators simplifies the detection process, distinguishing this approach  from other more complex biosensing methods. Our development system  shows great promise for point-of-care diagnostics, enabling the rapid  monitoring of VEGF levels in clinical settings. Its versatility lies in the  modifiability of the aptamer structure, allowing for potential adaptation  to detect other disease biomarkers, thus broadening its applicability in  personalised medicine. However, challenges such as aptamer stability in  complex biological environments and environmental sensitivity must be  addressed to optimise performance. Despite these limitations, the plat- form’s capability for real-time biomarker monitoring paves the way for  improved clinical decision-making and individualised patient care.  However, the application of aptamer-based electrochemical sensors  presents several challenges that must be addressed for broader clinical  implementation. A key concern is the stability of DNA aptamers,  particularly in complex biological environments such as blood serum,  where they are prone to nuclease degradation. This degradation can  significantly reduce the lifespan and effectiveness of the sensor. In  addition, the sensor’s performance may deteriorate if the aptamer loses  its structural integrity or binding affinity for VEGF. The specificity and  accuracy of VEGF detection in real-world biological samples may also be  compromised by interfering substances, leading to non-specific binding  or signal interference, and resulting in false-positive or false-negative  readings. Furthermore, aptamer-based electrochemical sensors are sen- sitive to environmental variables, such as temperature and pH, which  can affect aptamer folding and binding efficiency, potentially producing  unreliable results. Lastly, these sensors may exhibit a limited dynamic  range, which could restrict their ability to measure VEGF concentrations  across the wide range observed during different stages of disease pro- gression. Addressing these challenges is critical to fully harness the  potential of aptamer-based sensors in clinical diagnostics.
