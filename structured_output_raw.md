INTRODUCTION 
Every living cell is surrounded by plasma membrane. It protects and 
separates the inside of the cell from the outside. Membrane consists mainly of 
phospholipids arranged in two-layer structure where the hydrophilic heads are 
directed outward and the hydrophobic tails are directed inwardly of the 
bilayer. Plasma membrane has the property to accommodate different 
proteins: integral (such as ion channels) [1] and peripheral (such as electron 
carriers, enzymes or peptides) [2] membrane proteins. Therefore membrane 
models were developed as a platform for protein studies [3].  
 
The first lipid membrane model was called black lipid membrane [3]. 
Membrane was freely suspended in an aperture (diameter was usually between 
tens and hundreds of micrometers) of hydrophobic material [3],[4]. However 
main drawback of black lipid membranes was lack of stability, thus solid 
supported [5] and tethered [6] bilayer lipid membranes were developed. The 
addition of solid support for membrane models enabled to apply surface 
sensitive methods: atomic force microscopy, surface plasmon resonance or 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Tethered bilayer lipid membrane 
(tBLM), which was anchored to solid surface by a self-assembled monolayer 
[7] or a polymer layer [8], appeared to be the more favourable membrane 
model due to higher stability. 
The key point of membrane applicability for protein studies is the 
existence of thin ionic reservoir between solid support and phospholipid 
bilayer [9]. It acts as a cytosol and ensures incorporation of transmembrane 
proteins inside lipid membrane without the loss of protein biological activity. 
Hence, anchoring self-assembled monolayers have been developed that 
ensures ionic reservoir formation during phospholipid bilayer formation 
[6][7][9]. Most studies of phosholipid bilayer formation have been done on 
gold-thiol systems [6][7][9][10][11]. The strong covalent bond between gold 
and thiols (Au-SR) ensures the stability of formed layers and such systems 
proved to be applicable for protein studies [12] or for the development of 
biosensors [13][14]. However, due to expensive preparation and the lack of 
optical transparency of gold surfaces other substrates could be considered for 
tethered bilayer membrane formation. One of the examples include metal 
oxides and their functionalisation with silane based self-assembled 
11 
 
monolayers have been showed on different oxide surfaces: indium tin oxide 
[15], sputtered Ti/TiO2 [16],  metallurgical Ti [17] and Al [18]. The 
commercial availability and ease of preparation are some of the beneficial 
properties of the metal oxides. These properties enhance the applicability of 
oxide surfaces as substrates for the phospholipid bilayer formation. However, 
the lack of commercially available silane based molecular anchors prevents 
from developing tethered bilayer membranes on metal oxide surfaces with thin 
ionic reservoir. Nevertheless, phospholipid bilayer formation on metal oxide 
surfaces could improve the known gold-thiol system by decreasing the 
effective cost of membrane related investigations or possible application as 
biosensing devices. 
The aim of this study was to design and characterise phospholipid 
bilayers on metal oxides, particularly on cadmium tin oxide and fluorine 
doped tin oxide surfaces as well as to demonstrate the application of 
phospholipid bilayers for the development of biosensors for membrane 
damaging/pore forming toxins detection. 
The objectives of this study: 
1. To establish optimal conditions of cadmium tin oxide thin film 
deposition for the formation of OTS self-assembled monolayer and 
phospholipid bilayer membrane. To characterise SAM and bilayer with CA, 
CV and EIS methods. 
2. To establish optimal conditions of OTS SAM formation on fluorine 
doped tin oxide. To investigate phospholipid bilayer membrane formation and 
test the functionality of the membrane with vaginolysin and phospholipase A2 
toxins. To apply SECM method for the characterization of modified FTO 
surface along with EIS, CV and CA methods. 
3. To investigate phospholipid bilayer membrane formation on fluorine 
doped tin oxide surface functionalised with mixed SAM consisting of OTS 
and MTS and test the functionality of the membrane with melittin toxin. To 
investigate surface hydration effect on SAM and bilayer membrane properties. 
To characterise formed SAM and bilayer with CA, CV and EIS methods. 
4. To functionalize FTO surface with synthesized trichloro(3-
(octadecylthio)propyl)silane (TOPS) molecular anchor for tethering bilayer 
lipid membrane formation containing water reservoir between the solid 
surface and the membrane. To investigate biological relevance of the 
membranes with pore-forming toxin α-hemolysin. To characterise formed 
SAM and bilayer with CA and EIS methods. 
5. To test the reusability of silane-based self-assembled monolayers on 
FTO surface for the formation of phospholipid bilayer.

SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY 
Artificial membrane models were designed as a platform to study 
membrane/protein related processes. Most studies of artificial membrane 
systems have been done on gold surfaces modified with alkylthiol self-
assembled monolayers. However, these systems display several drawbacks. 
First, anchoring molecules exhibit surface mobility on gold surfaces resulting 
in cluster formation, that lipid bilayer would not form after vesicle fusion on 
the same sample, therefore gold substrates are disposable after single use. 
Second, atomically flat Au surface is usually prepared by magnetron 
sputtering device and the overall expenses of buying the material itself make 
the preparation of the potential biosensing device expensive. Additionally, 
gold surfaces are not transparent and could not be investigated by optical 
methods. Meanwhile, metal oxides are cheaper, do not require expensive 
devices for preparation, oxides as thin films are transparent and silane based 
self-assembled monolayers, exhibiting the chemical stability of siloxane 
bonds could be potentially reused for lipid bilayer formation. Thus, metal 
oxides functionalized with silane-based SAM are promising platform for 
artificial lipid membrane formation. However the lack of research in this 
particular scientific area as well as essential materials for the development of 
tethered bilayers on metal oxide surfaces are major challenges for developing 
tBLMs. With respect to the aforementioned problems, the major contributions 
of this thesis are: 
1. Optically transparent, low-cost in preparation and/or commercially 
available thin films of cadmium tin oxide and fluorine doped tin oxide 
functionalized with OTS monolayers were proposed to use for DOPC/Chol 
phospholipid bilayer formation. 
2. It was demonstrated that in contrast to similar tBLMs on gold, 
phospholipid bilayers on silanized FTO surface can be easily regenerated 
several times without losing their functionality. 
3. It was determined that depending on FTO surface hydration 
phospholipid bilayers can be formed on SAMs with even sparsely populated 
OTS molecular anchors (containing up to 80% of MTS back-filler). 
4. Simplified procedure for the tethered bilayer membrane formation on 
FTO surface functionalised with synthesised silane based molecular anchor 
was proposed, and biological relevance of formed membranes with pore 
forming toxins melittin and α-hemolysin was shown. 
To sum up, metal oxides, such as cadmium tin oxide and fluorine doped 
tin oxide can be successfully applied for phospholipid bilayer formation, 
reducing the expenses for the development of biosensors for toxin detection.

STATEMENTS FOR DEFENCE: 
1. Cadmium tin oxide and fluorine doped tin oxide functionalised with 
OTS can be used for the hybrid bilayer membrane formation.  
2. Scanning electrochemical microscopy along with CA, CV and EIS 
can be used for self-assembled monolayer characterisation. 
3. Fluorine doped tin oxide functionalised with a mix of OTS molecular 
anchor and short-chain MTS can be used for the formation of mixed hybrid 
bilayer membrane suitable for reconstitution of melittin toxin. 
4. Synthesised trichloro(3-(octadecylthio)propyl)silane molecular 
anchor can be used for fluorine doped tin oxide functionalisation and 
formation of the tethered bilayer membrane containing submembrane water 
reservoir that is needed for functional reconstitution of α-hemolysin pores.  
5. Surface of fluorine doped tin oxide functionalised with silane based 
self-assembled monolayer can be used multiple times for the formation of 
phospholipid bilayer membrane exhibiting the same electrochemical 
properties.

1. LITERATURE REVIEW 
1.1. Phospholipid bilayer membrane 
Cell is the smallest structural unit of every living organism. It is 
surrounded by plasma membrane, which separates interior of the cell from the 
outside. Plasma membrane is two dimensional bilayer that consists mainly of 
phospholipids, but also includes sphingolipids, sterols, proteins [19]. 
Phospholipids have hydrophilic phosphate heads and hydrophobic tails of two 
fatty acid chains. Due to amphiphilic structure of phospholipids, hydrophobic 
tails are facing inwards and hydrophilic heads are facings outwards in the 
bilayer membrane. The hydrophobic interior and  hydrophilic exterior of the 
membrane, makes it a convenient platform for immobilization of different 
types of proteins [20].  
Fig. 1. Fluid mosaic membrane model, where proteins are embbeded in lipid 
matrix [21]. 
The composition of the lipids in the membrane influences 
physicochemical properties of the membrane. There are four types of 
phospholipids that are predominant in cell membrane: phosphatidylcholine 
(PC), 
phosphatidylethanolamine 
(PE), 
phosphatidylinositol 
(PI) 
phosphatidylserine (PS).  Electrically neutral PC, PE, PI and negatively 
charged PS are important for membrane fusion, disassembly, apoptosis, 
membrane-mediated cell signalling [22]. The saturation and length of fatty 
acids in phospholipids plays an important role in phase transition of the 
membrane. Lipids with longer chains and fully saturated have tendency to 
interact decreasing mobility of the lipids in the membrane, thus membrane 
transitions to gel (solid phase) [23]. To avoid it, membranes in nature contains 
a mixture of lipids with saturated and unsaturated, shorter and longer 
15 
 
hydrocarbon chains, increasing membrane fluidity [19]. Sterols, such as  
cholesterol, increase packing of the phospholipids in the membrane, prevent 
from hydrocarbon chains coming together and impede phase transition into 
gel maintaining membrane fluidity [24]. The diversity of lipids allows to form 
functional phospholipid membranes for different types of cells in eukaryotes 
(neurons, blood cells, etc), prokaryotes (bacteria, etc.) and for organelles of 
the cell [19]. In 1972 fluid mosaic membrane model was presented where 
proteins are embedded in lipid matrix by random distribution (Fig. 1) [21]. In 
general, lipid membrane is a complex structure that requires considerable 
amount of research. Therefore model membrane systems were developed to 
investigate the properties of phospholipid membranes [6][9][25][26][27][28]. 
The artificial bilayer provides milieu for reconstitution of biomaterials such 
as proteins [29][30], DNA chains [31], pore-forming toxins [32], etc. to study 
their functionality under conditions closely mimicking those in natural 
organisms. 
1.2. Model membrane systems 
1.2.1. Liposomes 
Liposomes are phospholipid bilayer membranes in spherical shape. 
They were first described by Bangham et al. in 1960s [33][34]. Liposomes are 
readily formed by exposing dehydrated phospholipids to aqueous solution 
[33]. Liposomes are classified as unilamellar vesicles or multilamellar 
vesicles (MLV). Freshly prepared liposomes usually are MLV, where each 
vesicle contains several concentric bilayers. Meanwhile unilamellar vesicles 
has only one bilayer and can be small (SUV, diameter 20-100 nm), large 
(LUV, diameter more than 100 nm), and giant (GUV, more then 1 µm). 
Liposomes are mostly applied for drug delivery. It enhances the effectiveness 
of the drug while reducing the toxicity of the drug.
