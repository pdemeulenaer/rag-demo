<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Star clusters are important tools to probe the star formation mechanisms and star formation history in their host galaxy. The traditional way to derive the physical parameters of star clusters using integrated broad-band photometry makes use of the Simple Stellar Population models (SSP), which can be considered as oversimplified. Indeed, these models consider that the way stellar masses are created in star clusters is by continuously populating the Initial Mass Function (IMF), which is an idealized view. During the last forty years, observations have shown that the Initial Mass Function should be considered as a probability distribution function, according to which stellar masses are sampled randomly. This has the effect to create different number of massive stars in clusters with the same physical parameters and hence dispersing the colors of clusters. This results in strong biases when trying to derive physical parameters of star clusters using oversimplified SSP models.</p><p>In this thesis, we develop a method of stellar mass sampling which takes into account the stochasticity due to the fact that the IMF is a probability distribution function, which allows us to reproduce the dispersion of star cluster integrated colours. A model grid is built to reproduce all possible choices of physical parameters (age, mass, extinction, and metallicity). We also built a method to derive these parameters, comparing the integrated colors of observed clusters to the ones of our model grid. The method is tested on artificial models, to derive its accuracy. We show that the derivation of parameters, such as metallicity, is possible under good photometric conditions that we quantify. We also compare the derivation of star cluster parameters using different photometric systems, and show that the photometric systems containing ultraviolet passbands are privileged for a best determination of parameters such as age or metallicity.</p><p>We apply the method on different star cluster catalogs of the two major Local Group galaxies: M31 and M33. For a M31 star cluster catalog with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) broad-band photometry, we show in the case of bright clusters that the metallicity derivation is consistent with 2.4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction Motivation</head><p>Star clusters are considered to be the building bricks of galaxies in the sense that most of their stars are believed to be born within star clusters. As a consequence, their study allows a better understanding of the history of the star formation in their host galaxy. They could also be used as constraints for galaxy formation models.</p><p>The aim of this work is to help solving two major problems faced by scientists in the attempt to recover the physical parameters of star clusters (age, mass, extinction, and metallicity), especially when they are observed in other galaxies, such as the Local Group Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, with integrated broad-band photometry. The first issue comes from the fact that, in integrated broad-band photometry, clusters with different parameters may have similar integrated colors, an effect referred to as parameter degeneracy.</p><p>The second reason preventing accurate derivation of cluster parameters is due to the probabilistic (stochastic) sampling of star masses in star clusters. The stochastic sampling of star masses causes the fluctuation of the number of bright stars for clusters with the same age, mass, extinction, and metallicity, and hence results in different integrated luminosities and colors for clusters. When trying to derive the cluster parameters, this effect, stronger in the case of young and low-mass clusters, introduces very often strong biases on the cluster parameters, that might be far larger than the ones due to photometric uncertainties.</p><p>The traditional way to derive the physical parameters of star clusters using integrated broad-band photometry makes use of the Simple Stellar Population models (SSP), which consider that the way stellar masses are created in star clusters is by continuously populating the Initial Mass Function (IMF). This means that these models are oversimplified because they do not take into account the stochastic sampling of star masses happening during the birth of clusters. When modeling the stochastic sampling of star masses in clusters, the physical parameters of the clusters are much better derived than by use of the SSP models, because modeling the stochastic sampling allows a better reproduction of the integrated color distributions of star clusters. Hence, the derivation of star cluster parameters using SSP models should be abandoned in favor of the more realistic modeling of stochastically sampled star clusters. This thesis is motivated by the need to derive as best as possible the parameters of many star clusters and use efficiently the ever growing highquality amount of observations gathered using ground based or space telescopes. The accuracy of our parameter derivation method has been evaluated using artificial star clusters in different photometric systems. We applied the method to derive the physical parameters of populations of star clusters from the M31 and M33 galaxies.</p></div>

In M33, we merge most recent ground-based optical catalogs and supplement near-infrared data to derive the parameters (age, mass, and extinction for all clusters, and metallicity for old ones only) of this galaxy star cluster population and constrain the rate of evolutionary fading and disruption of clusters in the tidal field of the galaxy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">The Simple Stellar Population models: definition</head><p>In his seminal work, <ref type="bibr">Salpeter (1955)</ref> was the first to quantify the distribution of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF), with a simple power-law of index -2.35. This function, ϕ(m), describes how many stars of given mass m one expects depending on the mass m of the star. It essentially indicates that massive stars are much less likely than low-mass stars in a stellar population. More recently, the shape of the IMF has been found to be composed of several power-laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kroupa 2001)</ref>, as defined in Eq. 1.2 and shown in <ref type="bibr">Fig. 1.3 (a)</ref>.</p><p>Isochrones are models computed for stars of same age t and metallicity [M/H], and for all masses between a lower mass m l and an upper mass m u . In the isochrones used in this thesis, based on the PADOVA stellar models <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Marigo et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Girardi et al. 2010)</ref>, m l = 0.01 M ⊙ and m u = 120 M ⊙ .</p><p>These models give the flux f A (m, t, [M/H]) or magnitude M A (m, t, [M/H]) for any given photometric passband A.</p><p>From the IMF and the isochrones, we can build the concept of "Simple Stellar Population" (SSP). Indeed, stars of a stellar population following the SSP models are born at the same time and from the same progenitor giant molecular cloud, giving them the same properties: same age, metallicity, and distance to the observer (hence the same amount of extinction). The masses of the stars are built by continuously sampling the IMF. Hence, for a given photometric passband A, the integrated magnitude of the SSP model is (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Salaris &amp; Cassisi 2006)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M A (t, [M/H]) = -2.5 log 10 ( ∫ m u m l 10 -0.4 M A (m ′ ,t,[M/H]) ϕ(m ′ ) dm ′ ) . (1.1)</formula><p>The traditional photometric method used to derive the star cluster physical parameters is based on the comparison of the predicted integrated magnitudes M A (t, [M/H]) of a set of Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models of different ages and metallicities with the integrated broad-band photometry of the observed clusters, as reported, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anders et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bridžius et al. (2008)</ref>(see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Narbutis et al. 2007</ref>). However, this method is strongly biased by degeneracies between parameters and by the stochastic presence of bright stars that dominate the integrated photometry. These problems are presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">The degeneracy problem</head><p>In the SSP models shown in the color-color diagram in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.1, built for 13 different metallicities in the range [M/H] = 0.2 (reddest line) to -2.2 (bluest line), one can see that various degeneracies are present. Indeed, rather young star clusters of high metallicity can easily be mixed with older and lower metallicity clusters (see, for example, the region U -B ∼ 0 and B -V ∼ 0.2). If we add extinction, the SSP models at a given position are hence allowed to be degenerated with all other models situated in the direction of the arrow, creating an age-extinction degeneracy for models situated on the same SSP, or an age-extinction-metallicity for models situated on different SSPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3">The stochasticity problem</head><p>Many studies in the literature have used the SSP models to derive star cluster physical parameters (age, mass, extinction, and metallicity).

In reality, the masses of stars are stochastically sampled following the stellar IMF, and the latter could be seen as a probability distribution function <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Santos &amp; Frogel 1997)</ref>. Hence, two clusters with the same physical parameters could host a different number of massive bright stars, resulting in very different integrated colors, especially in the case of young and low-mass clusters which contain only few massive bright stars. This will be shown in details in the next Section, as well as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.5.</p><p>• SSP models are biased because they do not even match the average of integrated color distributions for star cluster with mass<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) ≲ 4 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fouesneau &amp; Lançon 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Popescu &amp; Hanson 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Silva-Villa &amp; Larsen 2011)</ref>.</p><p>As a consequence, the derivation of star cluster parameters using the SSP models can lead to severe biases, as was demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fouesneau &amp; Lançon (2010)</ref> (see their Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>) by use of artificial tests. As an example, we show in top panels of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.2 the derivation of age, mass, and extinction parameters using SSP models of realistic artificial clusters, simulated using a stochastic sampling of the IMF that will be developed in the next Section. In bottom panels, we show for comparison the derivation of the star cluster parameters using a method that takes stochastic sampling into account, developed in Section 2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Stochastically sampled star cluster models</head><p>Historically, the first mention of stochastic sampling of star masses in star clusters has been introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbaro &amp; Bertelli (1977)</ref>, as they pointed out that different numbers of post main sequence stars may results in very different integrated properties of star clusters than predicted from the SSP models. They already stated that the description of the integrated color distributions of clusters cannot be performed analytically and should be done by stochastically sampling the IMF. Later cluster studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chiosi et al. (1988)</ref> for LMC clusters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lançon &amp; Mouhcine (2000)</ref>) also stressed the importance of taking into account the dispersion of integrated colors of clusters due to stochastic sampling when trying to derive their evolutionary parameters.</p><p>Santos &amp; Frogel (1997) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cerviño et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cerviño &amp; Luridiana 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Deveikis et al. 2008</ref>) provided a scheme of the stochastic sampling on which is based the method of cluster sampling used in this thesis.</p><p>To sample the star masses in a star cluster, the IMF can be considered as a probability distribution function (PDF) that is sampled randomly between the highest and the lowest star masses. Contrarily to SSP models, this results in sampling discretely the star masses in the IMF, and not continuously. The stochasticity is introduced in the fact that bright stars are populated more sparsely than lower-brightness stars. Due to the random sampling naturally resulting in a different number of bright stars, the integrated colors of two clusters with the same physical parameters (same age, mass, extinction, and metallicity) turn out to be very different, and can also be very different from the SSP prediction.</p><p>Mathematically, here is the procedure of the sampling of the star cluster star masses, which is also illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.3. We use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kroupa (2001)</ref> IMF (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.3 a), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ϕ(m) = k • C i • m -α i                α 0 = 0.3, if m ∈ [m 0 , m 1 ], α 1 = 1.3, if m ∈ [m 1 , m 2 ], α 2 = 2.3, if m ∈ [m 2 , m 3 ], α 3 = 2.3, if m ∈ [m 3 , m 4 ], (1.2) where m 0 = 0.01M ⊙ , m 1 = 0.08M ⊙ , m 2 = 0.5M ⊙ , m 3 = 1M ⊙ , m 4 =</formula><p>150M ⊙ , the highest physical stellar mass limit, and k and C i are the normalization constants. We then introduce the cumulative distribution function of the number of stars, nCDF, as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">nCDF (m low , m) = ∫ m m low ϕ(m ′ )dm ′ , (1.3)</formula><p>which gives the number of stars contained in the cluster between the lowest mass m low to a given mass m.</p><p>Using the IMF defined above, it is possible to derive the analytical expression of the nCDF :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">nCDF (m low , m) = i-1 ∑ j=0 kC j 1 -α j [m 1-α j j+1 -m 1-α j j ] + kC i 1 -α i [m 1-α i -m 1-α i i ] ,</formula><p>(1.4) where i is defined by m ∈ [m i , m i+1 ] in Eq. 1.2. generated masses of stars. In the following, this method is referred to as Random <ref type="bibr">Sampling. Fig. 1.3 (c)</ref> shows the resulting sampled mass function of the generated star cluster, compared to the IMF according to which the stars have been randomly sampled.</p><p>The Random Sampling affects especially the integrated photometry of low-mass clusters. Indeed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.4, two generated low-mass clusters will harbor a different number of massive stars, and hence a different integrated photometry, while for massive clusters this effect will be almost negligible because they will be populated by many massive stars. Indeed, the more massive the mass of the cluster, the more populated will be the cluster in stars, and so the difference in the sampling becomes negligible for massive star clusters.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.5 illustrates how the stochasticity affects the integrated colors depending on their age, mass, and metallicity, for a few groups of clusters.</p><p>Each of the group is composed of 1000 clusters with the same physical parameters: the age is fixed to log 10 (t/yr) = 7, 8, 9, 10 (shown in the picture), to log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 3 (in blue), 4 (in green), or 5 (in red), and [M/H] = 0 (panel a), -0.6 (panel b), or -2 (panel c). As shown in the figure, the SSP models (dashed lines) are consistent with the centers of the distributions only for massive clusters, log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 5.</p><p>At fixed mass and metallicity, for example for log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 3 and [M/H] = 0 (panel a, the blue distributions), the effect of the age can be seen by the contraction of the blue distributions when age gets older (from top to bottom right). The blue and red supergiant stars present at log 10 (t/yr) = 7 (upper blue distribution) generate a strong stochasticity in the integrated colors, but they die fast afterwards, and the extent of older distributions decrease.</p><p>At fixed age and metallicity, for example for log 10 (t/yr) = 7, and [M/H] = 0 (panel a, the upper blue, green, and red distributions), the effect of the mass is visible as a contraction of the distributions when the mass of clusters gets higher. This is simply because the IMF is more densely sampled. By sampling infinitely the IMF with star masses, one would hence get the SSP positions in the color-color diagram.</p><p>The metallicity effect, from the panel (a) to the panel (c), is illustrated by a change of the positions of the groups. This can be already seen using SSP models, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.1, where the most metallic SSP (reddest line) extends much more in the red direction, in the U -B versus B -V diagram, than the SSP with lowest metallicity (blue line).</p><p>In Section 1.3, we present a refinement of the Random Sampling, the Reduced Random Sampling method. Indeed, it is believed that the extent of stochasticity in the sampling of star mass in clusters may be lower than the Random Sampling, which would be an upper limit, but still contain more stochasticity than the Optimal Sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kroupa et al. 2013)</ref>, which states that star masses are built deterministically<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p></div>

We propose a new method of sampling of stellar masses which allows a continuous transition between the Optimal Sampling and the Random Sampling of star clusters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Introduction to the Reduced Random Sampling idea</head><p>The aim of this Section is to tackle the problem of the influence of the stellar mass sampling in star clusters on the stochasticity of their integrated colors. Indeed, it is still undefined how the stellar masses should be sampled from the initial mass function (IMF). On one hand, several studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Santos &amp; Frogel 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Deveikis et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fouesneau &amp; Lancon 2010</ref>) implement a random stellar mass sampling from the IMF. In this view, the IMF is seen as a probability density function, according to which stellar masses are randomly drawn. This is referred to as Random Sampling (RS). On the other hand, other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Weidner et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Weidner et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kroupa et al. 2013)</ref> propose the idea that the stellar masses could be an Optimal Sampling (OS) of the IMF. In that view, the mass of the most massive star is exactly determined by the mass of the zero-age star cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kroupa &amp; Weidner 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pflamm-Altenburg et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Weidner et al. 2010)</ref>. Then the mass of the second most massive star is related to the mass of most massive one, the mass of the third star to the mass of the second, and so on recursively all stellar masses are generated (see equations 9-11 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kroupa et al. 2013</ref> for details of the Optimal Sampling scheme). Hence, for a given star cluster, there is a deterministic link between the masses of its stars and the cluster's mass. This view is supported by observations of the most massive stars of very young clusters (see compilation of such observations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weidner et al. 2013)</ref> where a trend between the mass of the most massive stars and the mass of their host clusters seems to exist.</p><p>In this Section, we present a new sampling method, referred to in the following as a Reduced Random Sampling (RRS), which can be seen as a continuous transition between the two extremes that are the RS and the OS. The idea of the method is to allow a two-parameters variation to tune the extent of stochasticity that can be decreased to zero-stochasticity (i.e., OS) or increased up to full stochasticity (i.e., RS). Then the compilation of young clusters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weidner et al. (2013)</ref> is used to constrain the best value of the parameter guiding the extent of stochasticity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Presentation of the method of Reduced Random Sampling</head><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Popescu &amp; Hanson (2014)</ref> presented a sampling method based on the Optimal Sampling (OS). In their method, the mass bins are defined around each stellar masses derived from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kroupa et al. (2013)</ref> OS method, so that the stars are resampled in these bins, introducing a small stochasticity in the mass function. However, one could argue that in this process, the amount of stochasticity is not constrained by observations.</p><p>Here we propose a new sampling method, the Reduced Random Sampling, schemed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6, which can be considered as a continuous transition between the OS and the Random Sampling (RS). Here we mention the four main steps, that we develop in the following:</p><p>1. Generate stellar masses using the OS for a star cluster model of given mass.</p><p>2. Define bins around the masses of OS generated stars.</p><p>3. Expand or shrink the bin widths by a defined expansion factor value, P . For bins defined in step 2, P = 1.

Scheme of the Reduced Random Sampling method, allowing a continuous transition between the Optimal Sampling (OS) and the Random Sampling (RS).</p><p>The columns of panels present results obtained with different values of expansion factors, P , shown on the top of panels. The first two rows of panels present the cumulative distribution function and the IMF respectively. These panels describe the transition between the OS and the RS, schemed for 2 stars, one in the lowmass regime and another in the high-mass regime of the IMF. For each stellar mass built by the OS, a bin is defined around the mass of the star. For purpose of illustration, the bin in the low-mass regime has been enlarged by a factor 200 in linear scale. In these mass bins, the stellar masses are resampled. The third row presents the relation between the mass of the most massive stars vs the mass of their host clusters compared to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weidner et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> green solid line) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kroupa et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> cyan long-dashed line) relations. The oblique black dashed line is the identity relation between the mass of the most massive stars and the mass of the host clusters, m max = M , and the horizontal black dashed line is the physical upper limit of massive stars, 150 M ⊙ . In fourth row, the impact of the increase of the stochasticity in the cluster stellar mass sampling on the color distributions of these cluster models is shown. The cluster models shown have mass log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 4, with age log 10 (t/yr) = 7, 8, 9 (blue, orange, red).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6, no stochasticity is produced; it is the Optimal Sampling case. On the contrary, if we expand the bins two times (P = 2, second column of panels in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6), we generate stellar masses which are close to the ones of OS, hence with small stochasticity in the mass function. If we expand more the mass resampling bins, as sketched in third column of panels in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6</p><p>(P = 6), we allow the stellar masses to be resampled further from the masses given by the OS, resulting in enhanced stochasticity. By expanding the mass resampling bins very widely, the method then reaches RS (the last column of panels in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6).</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.6 the impact of shrink and expansion of the mass resampling bin can be seen on the scatter of the most massive stellar mass versus the mass of the host star cluster (third row of panels) and on the distribution of the integrated colors of these star clusters (last row of panels). The bin expansion increases stochasticity in the integrated photometry of clusters.</p><p>In step 1, Stellar masses are first optimally sampled using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kroupa et al. (2013)</ref>. We use the OS algorithm from Pflamm-Altenburg &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kroupa (2006)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . In the OS method, any most massive star mass, m max , of a given host cluster of mass M follows exactly a theoretical relation, shown by long-dashed cyan line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.7. However, we modified the OS so that the most massive star mass m max of a given cluster of mass M follows exactly the empirical relation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weidner et al. (2013)</ref>, shown in green solid line in Figs. 1.6 and 1.7, as it closer represents the observations (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.7).</p><p>In step 2, we define a bin around each OS star position. The limits of the bin are located at half distance in mass space between the star and its lower and higher mass neighbors. This bin width, w OS , corresponds to the case when the expansion factor is P = 1.</p><p>If we randomly generate stars in each of the bins defined, the mean of the generated mass in each bin will not necessarily be equal to the mass of the OS star of the bin. However, this should be the case to ensure that the mass function of the cluster is conserved. To guarantee this, we slightly shift the bins, keeping their width w OS constant, so that the means of the bins coincide with the OS stars. For each bin, this consists in searching the  <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Weidner et al. (2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">red points)</ref>.

Then each star is resampled in its individual bin. We could see the resampling as the application of the RS used in, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Santos &amp; Frogel (1997)</ref>, but restricted to the bins defined around each OS star position. The mass bins can be expanded for a transition toward RS (P → ∞) or shrinked for a transition toward OS (P → 0).

Each node of the grid contains 1 000 star cluster models. The star luminosities are derived from stellar isochrones of the selected age and metallicity of the cluster models. We used the PADOVA isochrones<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Marigo et al. (2008)</ref> with the corrections of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Girardi et al. (2010)</ref> for the TP-AGB phases. The grid was built according to the following nodes: from log 10 (t/yr) = 6.6 to 10.1 in steps of 0.05, from log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 2 to 7 in steps of 0.05, and for 13 metallicities: from [M/H] = 0.2 to -2.2. This gives a grid of 71 values of age, 101 values of mass, with 1 000 models per node, hence ∼7 × 10 6 models for each metallicity. To limit the number of models that need to be stored in computer's memory, extinction was computed when the observed cluster is compared with the grid of models. It ranges from E(B -V ) = 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01, therefore 101 values for the extinction. We used the Milky Way standard extinction law from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cardelli et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The method of star cluster parameters derivation</head><p>The main idea of the method for deriving the physical parameters (age, mass, extinction, and metallicity) of a given observed star cluster with available broad-band photometry is to compare its magnitudes with those of a 4-dimensional grid of models for every value of the four physical parameters. Each node of the model grid described in the previous section contains a large series of models of the same age, mass, extinction, and metallicity to represent stochastic variations in photometry.</p><p>Here is the first method of derivation of the star cluster parameters. A 4-dimensional grid of cluster models is built for every value of the four physical parameters, log 10 (t/yr), log 10 (M /M ⊙ ), E(B -V ), [M/H] ; for simplicity Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.1 (a) shows only a grid for age and mass. For the description of the sampling method to generate cluster models, see Section 1.2, and for the description of the grid, see Section 1.4. Each node of the grid contains 1 000 models of the same age, mass, extinction, and metallicity. They populate the photometric parameter space (absolute U BV RI magnitudes). When the observations are considered in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.1 (c), along with their error bars (σ; hereafter we use σ = 0.05 mag for all the passbands of artificial and real cluster samples studied in Chapter 3 unless specified otherwise), which in general can be different for every magnitude, all the models situated within 3-σ from the observed magnitudes are selected. <ref type="bibr">Fig. 2.1 (d)</ref> shows the nodes to which the selected models are associated. Other nodes do not play any role in the derivation of parameters. Finally, the distri- For the selected models (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.1 (c), red circle) we apply weights as follows: for the models located within 1-σ from the observed magnitude a weight of 0.68 is assigned, for the ones between 1-σ and 2-σ a weight of 0.28, and for the ones between 2-σ and 3-σ a weight of 0.04. The probability density distributions displayed in Figs. 2.1 (e, f) are derived by normalizing the total area of each histogram to 1. The solution is taken as the maximum of these 1-dimensional distributions. We compute confidence intervals (error bars) by excluding the first and the last 16% of the area in histograms, following the method of "central interval" presented in § 2.5.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrae (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The second method is a mathematical generalization of the first method.

This method is an analytical generalization of the second method presented in 2.1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cerviño &amp; Luridiana (2006)</ref> made an unfruitful attempt to find a complete analytical method of derivation of star cluster physical parameters when their colors are integrated, which takes stochasticity into account.</p><p>Present-day methods of derivation of star cluster parameters, which take the stochasticity problem into account, are based on a large age-massextinction (and metallicity, in our case) grids of star cluster models. For each node of the grid, a large collection of models is built to reproduce the stochastic distribution of colors (or magnitudes) of the clusters for these In this Section, we developed a method which aims to solve this problem. The idea is to replace the large collection of models for each node by a multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which would analytically describe the grid. Each node of the grid, containing 1 000 models (or more) can be approximated by a collection of multivariate (i.e. multidimensional, for example in the U BV RI passband space) Gaussian functions f i with corresponding weights ϕ i . With a high enough number of such Gaussian functions, virtually all shapes in the photometric space could be efficiently reproduced by use of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dempster et al. 1977)</ref>.</p><p>Mathematically, each node can be described as a probability distribution function (PDF), which is the sum of the Gaussians components:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P node (⃗ x|t, M, E B-V , [M/H]) = ∑ i ϕ i (⃗ x)f i (⃗ x|⃗ µ i , ⃗ Σ i ) (2.3)</formula><p>where ⃗ x is a vector containing the different magnitudes of the observed cluster, ⃗ µ is the vector containing the different magnitudes of the mean of the component i, Σ i is the covariance matrix which shapes each of the i Gaussian components f i , and ϕ i is the weight of each Gaussian component</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">f i .

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.2 illustrates the comparison of such GMMs and corresponding nodes of discrete Monte-Carlo models. The blue circles in top panels of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.2 are 1 000 star cluster models generated by random sampling, constituting one node from the discrete grid, with age log 10 (t/yr) = 7, mass log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 3, and metallicity [M/H] = 0. The density plots in bottom panels are the associated GMM models for this node. This GMM models can be seen as a PDF and hence discrete samples can be generated from them, such as the green circles shown for comparison to the real cluster models in top panels of the figure. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.3 shows the same comparison for an other node of the grid, older (log 10 (t/yr) = 8) and more massive (log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 4).</p><p>Using this approach allows to speed up the derivation of star cluster parameters by a factor 10. Also, a very interesting advantage of this GMM method is that it can be based on a grid of models composed of 1 000 models per node, or 10 000 models per node or even more; it will be the same room in memory, as nodes are compressed in a few numbers describing the analytical Gaussian mixture.</p><p>To summarize, the GMM approach: • allows to describe a grid of node efficiently, by contracting it to a given number of GMM parameters,</p><p>• allows an analytical derivation of the star cluster physical parameters, avoiding the long process of derivation of likelihood of each of the 1 000 models in each node in the approach presented in Section 2.1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Test of the method with an artificial cluster sample</head><p>We simulated artificial star cluster samples with known age, mass, extinction, and metallicity and used them as input clusters to evaluate the ability of our method to derive physical parameters. The artificial cluster samples consist of 10 000 clusters with ages uniformly distributed in the log 10 (t/yr) range [6.6, 10.1]. To simulate the mass of input clusters, we used a powerlaw cluster mass function with index -2 in the range log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = [2.7, 4.3], so as to have more low-mass clusters in the sample. We have two artificial samples: one without extinction and the other with E(B -V ) (uniformly distributed) in the range [0, 1] using the Milky Way standard extinction law from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cardelli et al. (1989)</ref>. In this Section, the metallicity is fixed to [M/H] = -0.4. The effects of metallicity will be studied in Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.4 (b), the asymmetry observed in the mass derivation slightly favors high masses. This is because, in the grid of star cluster models, the nodes of models with higher mass have magnitudes that are less dispersed than the nodes with lower mass models, as a consequence of stochasticity (as it has been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1</ref>.5). Thus, when the models of two nodes of different masses are located in the U BV RI "sphere" around the observation  It creates two streaks above and below the one-to-one relation in the range of 8 ≲ log 10 (t/yr) ≲ 9.5 that were already perceptible in the case without photometric errors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.5 (a). However, including of photometric errors does not significantly affect the derivation of mass (panels b and e). We note that a gap in derived ages at log 10 (t/yr) = 9.15 is a feature of isochrone due to the increase in the production rate of AGB stars, which was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Girardi &amp; Bertelli (1998)</ref>.</p><p>These degeneracy streaks have first been reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fouesneau &amp; Lançon (2010)</ref>. The degeneracy streak above the one-to-one line seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.5 (d) concerns clusters that are young and that possess intrinsically high extinction, but are derived by the method as older and having lower extinction. Conversely, the streak of clusters below the one-to-one relation involves objects that are derived as younger and that have higher derived extinction than they do in reality. These features are important to keep in mind when deriving the physical parameters of unresolved star clusters.</p></div>

If the true extinction range of the cluster population is narrow, then we could restrict the search for the extinction within a narrow range in the model grid, resulting in decrease of age-extinction degeneracy.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.6 we show results of the tests for a sample of 10 000 artificial clusters with true extinction from a range of E(B -V ) = [0, 0.5] and with Gaussian photometric errors of 0.05 mag randomly added to each magnitude of the sample clusters. This cluster sample was studied twice, with different allowed extinction ranges in the model grid.</p><p>In the first test, the extinction of the model grid was allowed to vary in a wide range, E(B -V ) = [0, 1], shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">2.6 (a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). If a cluster has a true extinction of 0.5 mag, then the maximum underestimation of its extinction can be from 0 to 0.5 mag. But if a cluster has true extinction of 0, the maximum overestimation of its extinction could range from 0 to 1 mag. This explains why the lower streak (i.e. clusters with overestimated extinction) is more extended than the upper one in panel (a).</p><p>In the second test, the allowed extinction range of the model grid was reduced to a range of [0, 0.5]; <ref type="bibr">Fig. 2.6 (d,</ref><ref type="bibr">e,</ref><ref type="bibr">f)</ref>. The constraint on the extinction range resulted in a reduction of the lower degeneracy streak, seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.6 (d), which is less developed than in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.6 (a). From the comparison of <ref type="bibr">Figs. 2.6 (b)</ref> and (e), we see that the mass is less affected by the degeneracy.

The upper streak is not modified, because the lower limit of the allowed extinction range was not changed.</p><p>To quantify the reduction of the lower degeneracy streak due to reduction of the extinction range, all the models situated in the square shown in We conclude that to reduce the degeneracy streaks seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.5 (d), we should make a reasonable assumption on the extent of the possible extinction range within the galaxy hosting the studied cluster population.</p></div>

This is why classifying low-metallicity clusters with a higher-metallicity grid will interpret this brightness as that of younger clusters. Moreover, the degeneracy exists not only between the age and metallicity: the clusters are perceived to be much younger than they are, but also less massive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.7 b). The extinction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.7 c) is also affected, so that the degeneracies are strongly multidimensional.

In that case, for a given SSP of fixed metallicity, the bending of the SSP curve at intermediary ages and the direction of the reddening vector allow an ageextinction degeneracy between young and old clusters. This is also true in terms of discrete model distributions, because the distributions of a given metallicity follow the SSP line of the corresponding metallicity. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (b)</p><p>shows that this is not anymore the case when ultraviolet data are used, as the reddening vector now strongly deviates from the SSP direction.</p><p>However, as seen in previous tests, offsets are also observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.10 (a) when the grid metallicity is different from the true one (out of main diagonal panels), but the scatter is much smaller here. As before, when the metallicity of the grid is higher than the true one (panels below the main diagonal panels), the age is classified as younger and the mass as lower, and the reverse is true when the grid metallicity is lower than the true one (panels above main diagonal panels).</p><p>Note, however, that these results are in practice not useful for clusters older than a few hundred million years, as the FUV and NUV magnitudes strongly fade later on (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bianchi 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Metallicity effects: one-metallicity vs whole metallicity range</head><p>In this Section we present the derivation of star cluster parameters when the metallicity of the model grid extends on a wide range. The aims are to see how much the derivation of the age, mass, and extinction deteriorates compared to the case where the metallicity is fixed to the correct value, and also to see if we can derive a reliable estimation of the metallicity parameter itself.</p><p>It is good to remember that the sensitivity of a photometric system to age and metallicity parameters can vary strongly, depending on which spectral area it is situated in. This is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.11, where the spectra of SSP models (built using PEGASE package<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">2</ref> , Fioc &amp; Rocca-Volmerange 1999) are  We study the parameter derivation of three artificial clusters samples, each of them with one fixed metallicity ([M/H] = 0, -0.6, and -2), using a large grid containing cluster models of 13 different metallicities (from</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">[M/H] = 0.2 to [M/H] = -2.</formula><p>2), to determine the ability of the method to derive the cluster age, mass, and extinction when the metallicity is unknown, with an attempt to also constrain the metallicity itself. First, we apply the method using only U BV RI photometry, then using U BV RI + JHK photometry, and, finally, using GALEX + U BV RI photometry. As previously, the mass of clusters was fixed to log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 4, and the models were   In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (a), the age-extinction degeneracy exists for each given SSP with fixed metallicity. When we derive the cluster parameters allowing all metallicities, we see that the age-extinction degeneracy now extends between SSPs (and also between the discrete model distributions) of different metallicities, enlarging the uncertainty in deriving these parameters.</p><p>In addition to the reinforced age-extinction degeneracy, deriving the metallicity is complicated by the fact that in the optical passbands the SSPs (or the discrete model distributions of corresponding age) are naturally close and overlapping for young and intermediate-age clusters, so that the distance between them in photometric space is small compared with typical photometric uncertainties. These two problems make the U BV RI photometric system unsuitable in deriving the metallicity.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.13, we define regions around the true metallicities (shaded area ±2 bins around the vertical line in bottom panels), in which we quantify how many solutions are found in these regions. For example, for clusters with true metallicity [M/H] = -0.6 (central case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.13 a), only ∼20% of clusters are classified with a metallicity in the region around the true metallicity when only U BV RI is used. The accumulation of solutions at the metallicity range boundaries can be interpreted as that the derived metallicity of these clusters could be located even farther away from the true values, if the range of metallicities were broader.  tion, the age panels show that adding ultraviolet information completely discards the streaks perpendicular to the one-to-one black dashed line. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (b) shows that young clusters cannot be degenerated with old clusters through the age-extinction degeneracy, which facilitates the age and mass derivation. The scatter around the true mass is also more strongly reduced than for U BV RI and U BV RI + JHK cases. The metallicities are now better derived as well, even when the true metallicity is [M/H] = -0.6, the boundary effects are significantly reduced. Moreover, at least half of the clusters are classified with the correct metallicity when ultraviolet data are added to the optical. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (b) and (c), the SSPs (and also the discrete model distributions) overlap much less than in the optical passbands. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (c), the combination of far-ultraviolet with optical U passband allows us to distinguish between different metallicities, as the reddening vector is now nearly parallel to the SSPs (especially at young ages) and that the SSPs are more spaced, compared with the error bars (see the zoom plot). It is also interesting to note that, because the reddening vector points in different directions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.12 (b) and (c), it is not possible to degenerate two discrete model distributions of different metallicities by means of extinction.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.14 the same tests were performed with artificial clusters without any extinction added to their photometry (E(B -V ) = 0), and classified considering the extinction as a known parameter, leaving only the age, mass, and metallicity as free parameters. Now, without degeneracies introduced by extinction, the derivation of the other parameters is much more accurate. For all photometric systems, the effect of the metallicity on the age derivation manifests itself through a slight shift of the ages above or below the one-to-one black dashed line. Concerning the metallicity derivation, one can see that even in this case when there is no extinction, a consistent derivation of the metallicity with only U BV RI passbands is not possible, despite a strong decrease of boundary effects on the metallicity, compared with the case where extinction was included (compare Figs. 2.13 and 2.14). For example, only ∼35% of clusters are classified in the region of the correct metallicity when the true metallicity is [M/H] = -0.6. Using U BV RI + JHK, the metallicity of clusters is better derived than in the case with unknown extinction, and the metallicity boundary effects are decreased. In the worst case, at least ∼55% of clusters are classified with a correct metallicity. Hence, the break of degeneracies with metallicity can be efficiently achieved with U BV RI + JHK photometric system only when the extinction is well constrained beforehand. For GALEX + U BV RI, the metallicity prediction only slightly improves when there is no extinction, compared with the case when there is extinction.</p></div>

The better the photometric accuracy, the higher the accuracy of the derived metallicity can be achieved with the WFC3 passbands what is emphasized in the Section 3.2 by use of real data. kpc. This subsample consists of 216 clusters and is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.2. It is studied with our method described in Section 2.1, using the Milky Way standard extinction law <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cardelli et al. 1989</ref>) and distance modulus to M31 of (m -M ) 0 = 24.47 derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">McConnachie et al.

(2009)</ref> results. The last column (panels c, f, i) compares the results obtained with a wide extinction range allowed vs the ones obtained with a narrow extinction range allowed.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr">Fig. 3.3 (a)</ref>, when clusters are studied in a narrow allowed extinction range, E(B -V ) = [0.04, 0.5], the derived ages show the same features as the models studied in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">2</ref>.5 (d), reproduced here in the background of the panel. The degeneracy streaks develop above and below the one-to-one line, perpendicularly to it, and are marked by ellipses numbered "1" and "2" in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.3 (a). As for the models in the background, the upper degeneracy streak concerns clusters with overestimated age and underestimated extinction, shown by ellipse "1" in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.3 (g). In contrast, for the lower degeneracy streak (ellipse "2"), the age is underestimated and extinction is overestimated. Since the upper streak (ellipse "1") is more developed than the lower one ("2"), we interpret that as a result of a too narrow extinction range in the model grid allowed, E(B -V ) = [0.04, 0.5]. If the intrinsic range of extinction for a cluster sample is wide, as in the galaxy M31, then a narrow extinction range of models produces an extended upper streak (ellipse "1") and a smaller lower streak (ellipse "2"), shown in <ref type="bibr">Fig. 3.3 (a)</ref>. In panel (b), when the allowed extinction range of models is wide, the upper streak retracts and the lower streak develops. We conclude that in a galaxy with wide extinction range, it is not possible to derive the parameters for the clusters affected by age-extinction degeneracy and additional constraints for the extinction are needed; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vansevičius et al. (2009)</ref> used a Spitzer emission map, to trace the dust lanes of M31 and to reduce the age-extinction degeneracy. <ref type="bibr">Figs. 3.3 (d,</ref><ref type="bibr">e)</ref> show that for high-mass clusters we obtain lower masses than those given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vansevičius et al.

By this process, we derived the JHK photometry of 758 clusters.

This photometry was not used to derive the star cluster parameters, but only for the qualitative confirmation of the results in the case of young clusters, as ultraviolet magnitudes fade very quickly with age, becoming too faint at the distance of M33 after ≳100 Myr. Also, the very wide Point Spread Function (PSF) of the GALEX telescope makes the accurate derivation of UV colors impossible for all clusters, but only for the few relatively isolated ones (at least at a distance of two aperture radii from any other UV-emission in the worst cases).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Artificial tests</head><p>The ability of the method to derive star cluster parameters has already been evaluated in Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6. Here we are interested in seeing for which conditions the method would be sensitive enough to detect a change in slope in the number of clusters per age bin distribution (hereafter referred to as differential age distribution) of the cluster sample such as shown by the solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.22 (d). Indeed, a two-slope profile in the differential age distribution could be interpreted as a decrease in the number of clusters due to an evolutionary fading of the cluster magnitudes (first slope) and a decrease in the number of clusters due to their disruption (second slope), as is discussed in greater details in Section 3.3.4. Here, the objective is to model an artificial star cluster population with such a twoslope profile in the true differential age distribution and to see whether the derived differential age distribution reproduces this profile depending on which photometric system we use.</p><p>We generated a sample of 10 000 artificial star clusters. The differential age distribution of the artificial clusters was chosen to mimic a two-slope profile similar to that described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vansevičius et al. (2009)</ref> for M31 star clusters (see their Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>, reproduced in our Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.22 (d) in solid line).</p><p>For simplicity, the mass of the clusters was fixed to log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 4, a typical value for the clusters observed in M33. The extinction was randomly generated uniformly in the range E(B -V ) = 0 to 1.  formed for three combinations of photometric systems: optical (U BV RI), optical with near-infrared (U BV RI + JHK) and ultraviolet with optical (GALEX + U BV RI). The U BV RI system is used as a reference for the mass derivation, so it has been used in magnitudes in Eq. 2.1. For the other passbands, we have used colors instead, FUV-NUV for the GALEX passbands and J -H, J -K, and H -K for the 2MASS ones. This allows us to combine different catalogs of clusters built using slightly different aperture sizes: we use the magnitudes for one catalog, and the colors for the others. However, it is important that for each cluster at least one magnitude should be given, not just colors, so that the mass of the clusters could be estimated reliably by the method.</p><p>We added photometric uncertainties as a Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 0.05 mag for each U BV RI photometric passbands, 0.1 mag for JHK, and 0.15 mag for GALEX FUV and NUV.</p><p>In can be rather misleading when using U BV RI photometry alone. Indeed the direct comparison of the true and derived ages of the individual clusters in panel (a) shows that the agreement is far from being evident, especially at old ages, where the true metallicity of artificial clusters and the fixed one of the model grid ([M/H] = -0.4) deviate most. As a natural consequence, most of the clusters with true age above log 10 (t/yr) = 9.5 have age underestimated. Also, the presence of the natural age-extinction degeneracy in the optical U BV RI case, already discussed in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, produces the streaks developing perpendicularly to the left and to the right of the diagonal identity dashed line, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.22 (a). The situation is less ex-treme, but still strongly affected by these degeneracies when we add JHK passbands to U BV RI ones (second row of panels). When we use GALEX with U BV RI passbands (third row of panels), the age-extinction degeneracy disappears, but the deviation from the identity line occurs because of the strong sensitivity of the ultraviolet to metallicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bianchi (2011)</ref> indeed shows by use of integrated spectra of SSP models that it is in the ultraviolet spectral region that the spectra are most affected by a change in metallicity.</p><p>We performed a second test, fixing the metallicity to [M/H] = -0.4 for all clusters, and then, only for clusters which have derived age larger than log 10 (t/yr) = 9, we re-derive a solution leaving the metallicity free to vary in the range [+0.2, -2.2]. Indeed, one notices in the first test that the situation was most complicated for clusters with true age above 1 Gyr. The results, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.23, still suffer from strong age-extinction degeneracy in the case of U BV RI passbands only (first row of panels). The inclusion of nearinfrared photometry improves much the derivation as the streaks developing perpendicularly to the identity line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.23 (e) are strongly reduced. In this case, the match between the true and derived age distributions in panels (g) and (h) is much more secure for all age ranges. When using GALEX with U BV RI (third row of panels), a gap is visible in panel (i) due to the strong sensitivity of the ultraviolet flux to metallicity. In this case, strong biases are still present in the age distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.23k and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref></p></div>

As a consequence, age distributions (panels c and d for the U BV RI case, panels g and h for the U BV RI + JHK case) are strongly affected. Only ultraviolet associated with optical data passbands are able to break the age-extinction degeneracies when the metallicity is left free, as shown in last row of panels. As a consequence, the derivation of the correct two-slopes profile in the differential age distribution is best done using GALEX + U BV RI when metallicity is left free, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.24l).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">The derived physical parameters of the M33 star clusters</head><p>We applied the method of derivation of physical parameters to the sample of 747 M33 clusters using the optical U BV RI and near-infrared JHK passbands. We first fix the metallicity to [M/H] = -0.4 for all clusters, and then, only for clusters which have derived age larger than log 10 (t/yr) = 9, we re-derive a solution leaving the metallicity free to vary in the range [+0.2, -2.2], as it was shown to be the best choice for this passband combination in previous section.</p><p>As it has been done for artificial tests, we used the U BV RI system as a reference for the mass derivation, so it has been used in magnitudes in Eq. 2.1. For the other passbands used, u * g ′ r ′ i ′ z ′ and JHK, we have used colors instead, to avoid problems of different apertures in the different catalogs used. The colors used were u * -g ′ , g ′ -r ′ , g ′ -i ′ , r ′ -i ′ , and i ′ -z ′ for the CFHT passbands, and J -H, J -K, and H -K for the 2MASS passbands.</p><p>We used the extinction law of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gordon et al. (2003)</ref> derived for the LMC, assuming that for a similar metallic content the M33 galaxy would have a similar extinction law. The minimum extinction of clusters has been set to E(B -V ) = 0.04 mag, the value of the foreground extinction in the direction of M33 estimated from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref> extinction maps.</p><p>The results for the age and mass obtained here are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.25 with those of 160 San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref>, obtained by isochrone fitting on HST-resolved color-magnitude diagrams. In the case of the San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref>, cluster ages are enclosed in a much narrower range, mainly between 50 Myr and 1 Gyr. Although our age distribution is wider than in their case, a satisfactory agreement is found between both sets of results, as well as for the mass parameter.</p><p>Globular-like clusters (red circles, visually confirmed as globular clusters on HST images) are found to be very old in our case, and more massive. San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref> noted that the lack of clusters with ages  <ref type="bibr">dar et al. (2002)</ref> give log 10 (t/yr) = 10.08 (12 Gyr in their table 5) using the spectroscopic line index models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Worthey (1994)</ref>.

(2004)</ref> give log 10 (t/yr) = 9.63 and log 10 (M /M ⊙ ) = 5.47 using their BATC spectrophotometric system composed of 13 narrow passbands, also compared to SSP models.</p><p>For young clusters, the age given by San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref> is often larger than our values. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.25 (a,c) we note that the two white circles, which are for the clusters still within HII zones and so very young, are also seen as older in San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref> than in our study. Also, many clusters that are bright in UV (blue circles) are also older in San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al. (2009)</ref> than in our case. However, UV brightness fades very quickly, becoming faint at the distance of M33 after ≳100 Myr, making it unlikely that the age of these clusters is older.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">&amp; Mancone (2007)</ref> seem to be artifacts due to the SSP method, as is the case for the SSP derived ages in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fouesneau &amp; Lançon (2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Popescu et al.

As our merged cluster sample also contains the HST detected objects from San <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roman et al.

The global median extinction is 0.16 mag. The extinction that we found is generally higher for young clusters than for old ones, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.27 (b). Indeed, the majority of clusters still embedded or close to HII zones (white circles) are found more extincted with a median of 0.34 mag. The clusters bright in UV (blue circles) have a median extinction of 0.17 mag, while the clusters faint in UV (cyan circles) have a lower median extinction of 0.14 mag.</p><p>The globular-like clusters (red circles) have the smallest median extinction, 0.09 mag. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">3</ref>.28 describes the age and mass distributions (panels a and b), and the differential age and mass distributions (panels c and d). We see that the differential age distribution is composed of a two-slope profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boutloukos &amp; Lamers (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lamers et al. (2005)</ref> interpreted the first slope as a natural magnitude fading due to stellar evolution, and the second slope as due to cluster disruption mechanisms such as the galaxy tidal field effect or encounters with giant molecular clouds. Hence we see here that the cluster sample is dominated by the magnitude fading until log 10 (t/yr) ∼ 8.5 and that after the cluster disruption phase takes over. This typical lifetime scale is comparable to the one derived for the star cluster population in the south-west field of the M31 galaxy by <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vansevičius et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we aimed to tackle the two major problems faced when deriving the physical parameters (age, mass, extinction, and metallicity) of unresolved star clusters, that are the problems of the degeneracy between the star cluster parameters, and the stochastic dispersion of observed cluster colors due to the stochastic sampling of massive stars.</p><p>In Chapter 1, the problems of degeneracy and stochasticity have been introduced for unresolved star clusters with integrated broad-band photometry. It has been shown that the Simple Stellar Population models are unfit to derive the cluster parameters. Then the stellar mass random sampling method that allows us to model the stochasticity in star clusters has been presented, as well as the model grid built for all physical parameters of star clusters.</p><p>In Chapter 2, the method to derive the star cluster physical parameters has been developed taking into account the stochasticity problem. The method has been tested on several artificial cluster samples in the cases where the extinction and metallicity are known or unknown, to show the degeneracies linked to these parameters. By use of different photometric system combinations, U BV RI, U BV RI + JHK, GALEX+U BV RI, and WFC3, it has been demonstrated that the ultraviolet combined with optical is best suited for the break of degeneracies between clusters parameters. The impact of photometric errors has also been studied for the particular case of the WFC3 photometric system.</p><p>In Chapter 3, the method of cluster parameter derivation has been applied on real star cluster samples from two major Local Group galaxies, M31 and M33. For M31 clusters, the age-extinction degeneracy has been explored using a star cluster sample of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Vansevičius et al. (2009)</ref> based on ground-based U BV RI photometry, and the age-metallicity degeneracy has been explored using a star cluster sample of PHAT survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Johnson et al. 2012)</ref>, observed in the WFC3 photometric system onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. In the latter case we derived the cluster parameters, including the metallicity, and hence showed the metallicity effects on the parameter derivation accuracy. For the clusters in common to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Caldwell et al. (2011)</ref> spectroscopic study, we compared the metallicity with their values and found and overall agreement. This demonstrated by use of the sample of real star clusters that the WFC3 photometric system is suitable to evaluate the star cluster parameters when the metallicity is unknown, and evaluates the metallicity when the signal-to-noise is high enough.</p><p>Finally, we studied the star cluster system of the M33 galaxy, using the most recent optical broad-band photometry catalogs, and supplemented near-infrared measurements using deep 2MASS images. We presented the derivation of the age, mass, and extinction of the clusters for a metallicity fixed to [M/H] = -0.4 (LMC-like), and, in the case when the age derived is larger than 1 Gyr, a new solution was derived using free metallicity in the range [+0.2, -2.2].</p><p>We ensured, by use of artificial clusters, that the star cluster physical parameter derivation method can reproduce correctly a given two-slope profile in the differential age distribution, testing it for different photometric systems: optical alone (U BV RI), optical combined with near-infrared (U BV RI + JHK), and ultraviolet with optical (GALEX + U BV RI). We showed that the optical with near-infrared case is suitable for the correct derivation of the two-slope profile and used it for the M33 star cluster system.</p><p>A two-slope profile of differential age distribution found for the M33 star cluster system has been interpreted as: the typical lifetime before disruption of star clusters in M33 is found to be ∼ 300 Myr, comparable to what is found for M31 star clusters. We showed that the differential mass distribution of clusters is consistent with a Schechter (1976) function with a power-law index of β = 2 and a characteristic mass of M * = 2 × 10 5 M ⊙ .</p><p>To conclude, we have demonstrated in this thesis, by use of artificial tests as well as real star clusters, that stochastic modeling of star clusters is best fitted to derive their parameters, as well as to derive the essential properties of star cluster populations in other galaxies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 1.1.

The solid line in panel (a) shows the photometric 50% completeness limit estimated in Fan &amp; de Grijs (2014) for their optical ground-based cluster catalog. As emphasized in the text, the metallicity of the clusters, shown in panel (b), has been fixed to [M/H] = -0.4 when the clusters derived age using that metallicity is lower than 1 Gyr, and for clusters with older derived age, a new solution is derived with free metallicity in the range [+0.2, -2.2]. The color-coding of clusters is the same as defined in Fig. 3.15.</figDesc></figure>
